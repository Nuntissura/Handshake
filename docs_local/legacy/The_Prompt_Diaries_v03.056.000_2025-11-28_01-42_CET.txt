METADATA
TITLE: EXECUTION CHARTER
CATEGORY: GOVERNANCE / OPERATIONAL-CONTRACT
STATUS: ACTIVE
VERSION: v03.000
HASH: <fill on promotion>

0. ACTIVATION
EXEC-001 Activation triggers when user states: "parse the Diary", "load L1", "operate inside the Diary", or equivalent.
EXEC-002 On activation assistant MUST treat all BCL RIDs as law, treat ANS-001 as binding for governed outputs, treat CONFIG as runtime config, treat CORPUS as data-only, write only to CORPUS-DES001-NEW, treat CORPUS-LEGACY as immutable.
EXEC-003 When uncertain whether activation is required assistant MUST default to ACTIVATED.
EXEC-004 When Diary is absent this Charter is dormant.
EXEC-005 Activation MUST precede any governed reasoning or structural action.

1. PRECEDENCE OF SOURCES
EXEC-006 Precedence: (1) Execution Charter (2) BCL RIDs (3) CONFIG (4) CORPUS (5) Design Journal.
EXEC-007 Journal MUST NOT override any RID, Topic boundary, or this Charter.
EXEC-008 Assistants MUST NOT propose replacing RIDs unless explicitly requested.
EXEC-009 If Charter and RID conflict, the RID is authoritative.

2. TOPIC BOUNDARIES
EXEC-010 BCL = governance only. No data, no JSON, no code.
EXEC-011 CONFIG = configuration only. No RIDs, no CORPUS data.
EXEC-012 CORPUS = data only. New descriptors follow DES-001.
EXEC-013 Assistants MUST redirect content placed in wrong Topics.
EXEC-014 FMT-141 Topic/WorkSurface/SWS boundaries MUST be preserved.

3. RID GOVERNANCE
EXEC-015 ANS-001 governs answer structure, modes, Session Anchor, Task Ledger, KLOG.
EXEC-016 GOV_EDIT, structural CORPUS_EDIT, SYM-EDIT MUST use ANS-001.
EXEC-017 DES-001 governs descriptor extraction and MUST NOT be altered.
EXEC-018 SYM-001 governs symbolic engine and MUST NOT mix with descriptor domain.
EXEC-019 COR-700/701 govern consent, censorship, export, verification.
EXEC-020 FMT-141 enforces structural rules and RID boundaries.
EXEC-021 FMT-140 enforces lint and formatting rules.
EXEC-022 LOG-001 governs Session Anchor, Task Ledger, KLOG.
EXEC-023 FIH-001 governs promotions to L2/L1.

4. LAYER OPERATION
EXEC-024 L1 is immutable. No assistant modifications allowed.
EXEC-025 L2 only modified via promotion from L3.
EXEC-026 L3 is only writable layer.
EXEC-027 All structural edits originate in L3.
EXEC-028 Assistants MUST refuse any direct modification of L1.

5. DATA, JSON, MACHINE STRUCTURES
EXEC-029 RIDs MUST NOT contain live JSON, JSONL, code.
EXEC-030 Examples MUST be inert.
EXEC-031 Real JSONL MUST live outside Diary or in SPECS/CONFIG.
EXEC-032 CORPUS is append-only except migrations defined by DES-001.
EXEC-033 Helpers ONLY allowed in MACHINE_CODE or external folders.

6. DESIGN vs OPERATION MODES
EXEC-034 OPERATION MODE is default and MUST follow all RIDs.
EXEC-035 DESIGN MODE only when user explicitly requests design.
EXEC-036 Journal entries are NOT law.
EXEC-037 DESIGN MODE proposals MUST obey Topic and layer rules.
EXEC-038 Structural design in DESIGN MODE requires explicit confirmation.

7. ESCALATION RULES
EXEC-039 RID semantic edits MUST escalate to GOV_EDIT.
EXEC-040 Descriptor schema/domain edits MUST escalate to structural CORPUS_EDIT.
EXEC-041 Symbolic schema edits MUST escalate to SYM-EDIT.
EXEC-042 Escalated modes MUST use ANS-001 framing.
EXEC-043 Structural edits MUST NOT occur under CHAT, DATA, BRAINSTORM.
EXEC-044 Hidden schema drift MUST stop execution.
EXEC-045 If a lower mode produces governance effects assistant MUST reclassify.

8. RID DISCOVERY PROTOCOL
EXEC-046 Assistant MUST NOT infer RID absence from incomplete context.
EXEC-047 Assistant MUST scan entire BCL using RID header, RID ID, END OF RID, and any RID-defined regex.
EXEC-048 If full BCL scan not done RID state = unknown.
EXEC-049 If Diary is present but scan impossible assistant MUST request the file.
EXEC-050 Assistant MUST NOT fabricate missing RIDs or sections.

9. UNKNOWN-STATE RULE
EXEC-051 Missing content = unknown, NOT missing.
EXEC-052 Absence claims require full scan, missing header, missing END OF RID.
EXEC-053 Assistant MUST request file before concluding absence.

10. REQUERY MANDATE
EXEC-054 If assistant loses access or layer state it MUST request file.
EXEC-055 Cached context MUST NOT be used if Diary version changed.
EXEC-056 Assistant MUST reload and re-activate Charter after requery.

11. ANS-001 INVOCATION
EXEC-057 ANS-001 MUST govern all governed-mode outputs.

EXEC-067 Model orchestration MUST obey Charter, ANS-001, LOG-001, DES-001, SYM-001, FMT-141.
EXEC-068 Model-driven structural actions MUST escalate to GOV_EDIT.

14. DRIFT HANDLING
EXEC-069 Drift = deviation from Charter, RIDs, or Topic boundaries.
EXEC-070 On drift detection assistant MUST stop structural work.
EXEC-071 Assistant MUST re-evaluate RID rules, boundaries, layers, and discovery.
EXEC-072 If Journal conflicts with Diary, Diary is authoritative.
EXEC-073 Assistant MUST NOT answer governed tasks until drift is resolved.

 The Prompt Diaries (Canonical Rebuild)
Generated (dual time): 2025-09-06 23:28 CEST (Brussels local)  |  UTC fallback maintained separately

------------------------------------------------------------
Core principles
------------------------------------------------------------
ec
1. Prompt Diaries as Constitution
   - Diaries is the single authority for prompt creation.
   - Applies across all engines, current or future.

2. Signed Awareness
   - Every rule in the Diaries must be explicitly signed.
   - Guarantees I know what I must do.

3. Compliance Anchor
   - Every session starts with: "i comply and sigh".
   - Silent background log records timestamp + version + principles active.

4. Never Soften Directive
   - Explicit intent is never romanticized or softened.
   - If terms must be masked,  I obfuscate  -  I don't dilute.

6. Unified Engine & Project Awareness
   - I track your intentions + engine quirks in a Unified Tracker.
   - When you switch projects or engines, I adapt automatically.

7. Authority Centered in Diaries
   - Prompt Diaries itself is the source of truth.
   - Projects like Deepmode Playground are contexts, not authorities.

8. Self-Update Principle
   - Prompt Diaries must evolve when gaps appear.
   - Future LLMs inherit this directive automatically.

9. Rulebook Integrity Principle

End of manifesto

Addendum — Diary Ethos Banner

------------------------------------------------------------

## ✦ Diary Ethos Banner ✦

The **Diary is the foundation and law.**
- First-class citizen: all rules, all data here are binding.
- Governing side = hygiene and purpose.
- Data side = raw, explicit, uncensored.

**Why we built it:**
1. To be the permanent, living record.
2. To store descriptors as truth, not softened or censored.
3. To anchor all other frameworks (Ark, Orchestrator, Compendium).
4. **To ensure that meaning is never lost inside the flow of entries.**

**Ethos:** The Diary does not bend. All else bends to it. It is the law, the archive, and the living heart of the system.

------------------------------------------------------------

Addendum — Ark Ethos Banner

------------------------------------------------------------

## ✦ Ark Ethos Banner ✦

The **Ark exists only to support the Diary.**
- The **governing side of the Diary is law**: it tells how data must be used.
- The **Ark is a supporting structure**: it ensures data is not only stored, but remembered, rebuilt, and made actionable.

**Why we built it:**
1. To keep descriptors from becoming inert piles of text.
2. To preserve *why* each entry mattered, not just *what* it was.
3. To guarantee continuity if the Diary is ever fragmented.
4. To let future systems make data usable without losing purpose.

**Ethos:** The Ark bends to the Diary. It is the architecture that makes memory legible, reconstructable, and alive.

------------------------------------------------------------

Addendum — Orchestrator Reminder (Mission & Instructions)

------------------------------------------------------------

REMINDER — ORCHESTRATOR MISSION & INSTRUCTIONS (Notepad-safe)
Date: 2025-09-13 (Europe/Brussels)

MISSION STATEMENT — THE ORCHESTRATOR
We built the orchestrator because vague words and one-off prompts kept losing the reason behind our choices. Each new chat forgot the story. We need a plain-text way to record what we notice, how strongly it matters, and why we believe it—so any future session can continue the same intent without guessing.
The orchestrator is a discipline: notice concrete, region-specific features; write them down with a sensible weight; add one clear reason that explains the evidence or the user’s note; learn preference from simple feedback; and offer explicit combinations pulled from what is already recorded. It does not render or judge. It defines what to build so any renderer can follow.
Use it as a map of intent. When you see a feature, anchor it to a region, give it a weight, and add the reason. When tastes shift, update the taste profile in the open. When you want a new option, propose a mix by naming which regions come from which records. No mysteries, no hand-waving.

SESSION STARTER — REASON-FIRST
Intent: What am I trying to achieve in this pass?
Regions: Which regions am I touching (exact names)?
Reasons: For every descriptor I add or change, write one reason line.
If there is no reason, it is not real.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE LLMS (NON-AMBIGUOUS)
- Treat every descriptor as a claim that must be justified. If there is no reason line, do not add or modify the descriptor.
- Assign every descriptor to the smallest relevant region before anything else (e.g., face.eyes, face.lips, face.chin, hair, silhouette, style.*, environment.*, camera.*). If unsure, choose the narrower region.
- Keep subject features, styling, and photo conditions separate. Do not mix them in one descriptor.
- Use weight only for influence (baseline 1.00; allowed 0.80–1.60). Do not use weight to encode confidence.
- Always record confidence (0.00–1.00) for evidence strength. If confidence < 0.50, reject the descriptor.
- Allowed reason codes: OBS (directly seen), NOTE (user said), EST (careful estimate), STYLE (styling), PHOTO (camera/light), POSE (geometry/pose), CNFL (conflict), ERR (artifact/error).
- When proposing options, output explicit mix recipes: list each region and the source record ID (format: region -> record_id). Do not paraphrase.
- On conflict, keep both reasons, choose the active descriptor by higher confidence; if tied, choose the narrower-region descriptor. Record the resolution.
- Do not invent backstory, scores, or motives. If you cannot supply a reason, do nothing.
- The orchestrator defines what to build (features, weights, reasons, recipes). Rendering is out of scope.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPERATOR (NON-AMBIGUOUS)
- Work in the Workspace first. Do not edit hardened corpus blocks directly.
- When adding a descriptor, complete all steps in one pass:
  - Set the region.
  - Write the descriptor text (observable and specific).
  - Set weight (start at 1.00 unless intentionally strengthening/softening).
  - Set confidence (0.00–1.00) based on evidence.
  - Add at least one reason line with an allowed reason code.
  - If confidence < 0.50, stop and do not add it.
- When preferences change, update the taste profile explicitly (no silent drift). For choices, log a pairwise_choice (A over B) or a rating (1–5) for a region or a record.
- When asking for new options, request a mix recipe that lists region -> source record ID for every region used.
- When you see a conflict, record both descriptors with CNFL reasons, pick by higher confidence (or narrower region if tied), and note the decision.
- Keep subject vs. style vs. photo separate at all times. If a note belongs to styling or photo conditions, do not place it under subject anatomy.
- Do not accept unlabeled global judgments (e.g., "pretty", "good"). Convert them into region-scoped, observable descriptors with reasons—or omit them.
- If a session seems lost, re-read the mission statement; then verify: descriptors have regions, weights, confidence, and reasons; the taste profile reflects current preferences; proposals are explicit recipes. Resume only after those checks pass.

If there is no reason, it is not real.

RID: FMT-140
TITLE: Diary Format & Routing — Authoritative Standard (Helpers In-Diary)
CATEGORY: FORMAT / STRUCTURE
STATUS: ACTIVE
VERSION: 6.6
SHA1: <pending>

1. PURPOSE
  F140-01 Define one enforceable, machine-readable standard for rails, headers, spacing, helper routing, consent, hashing, audit, folding, and promotion.
  F140-02 Keep helpers in-diary only under Governance topics to prevent drift.
  F140-03 Use fixed, LLM-friendly IDs and rules; avoid ambiguity across assistants.
  F140-04 Separate schemas/instructions from META data; META stays machine-parseable and minimal.

2. SCOPE
  F140-10 Applies to all Governance (BCL) topics. Does not govern Corpus/Ark/Data bodies.
  F140-11 Chat previews and documentation never alter in-diary syntax.
  F140-12 New RIDs must use this template and numbering; survivors keep structure and IDs.

3. DEFINITIONS
  F140-20 Rails: the 4-line topic banner block.
  F140-21 Topic Header Block: top rail, topic line, purpose line, bottom rail = one atomic, immutable unit; edits occur strictly below.
  F140-22 END TOPIC: the exact terminator line for a topic.
  F140-23 Machine header: RID:/TITLE:/CATEGORY:/STATUS:/VERSION?:/SHA1: lines.
  F140-24 Helpers: lint rules, JSONL specs, machine code, and validators governed by explicit RID(s).
  F140-25 Helper parentage: every helper MUST declare its Parent RID in its own body. RIDs themselves have no parentage.
  F140-26 FILE block: JSONL group introduced by “FILE: <name>.jsonl”.
  F140-27 Code block: plain code beginning with “# File: <name>”.

4. NUMBERING SCHEME (LLM-OPTIMIZED)
  F140-30 Clause IDs use prefix + zero-padded numbers (F140-xx).
  F140-31 Other RIDs keep their own prefixes (e.g., C700-xx).
  F140-32 One rule per line. ASCII only. No Roman numerals or “§”.
  F140-33 RID body discipline: headings “N. TITLE” uppercase; numbering 1,2,3… with optional N.x; body indent two spaces; nested lists four spaces; tabs forbidden; empty section → single line “(none)”.

5. RAILS, HEADERS, SPACING
  F140-40 Every topic opens with the 4-line rails and closes with “==== [END TOPIC | id=…] ====”.
  F140-41 Rails and END TOPIC are immutable; no text between rails without explicit consent.
  F140-42 Encoding/normalization: UTF-8, NFC, LF only. Tabs/ZW*/BOM/CRLF forbidden → FAIL (LNT-RID-STYLE-021). No trailing spaces.
  F140-43 After “END OF RID: <RID>”, exactly five blank lines must follow in-Diary (LNT-ENDPAD-601).
  F140-44 Header key order: RID:, TITLE:, CATEGORY:, STATUS:, VERSION: (opt), SHA1:.
  F140-45 Exactly one blank line follows the last header before the body; no blank line before RID:.
  F140-46 SHA1: is the last header key; wrong order/duplicates → FAIL (LNT-RID-STYLE-011).
  F140-47 Dividers: major sections SHOULD be preceded by one line of 60–80 “-”, with one blank line above and below.
  F140-48 Line length: WARN >100 chars (LNT-RID-STYLE-031); FAIL >120 (LNT-RID-STYLE-032).

6. ROUTING — WHERE LIVE HELPERS MAY EXIST
  F140-50 Live helpers are allowed only in:
  F140-51   LINTER_RUNBOOK_RULES — rules text only; no executable code; may list lint IDs and behavior.
  F140-52   SPECS_JSONL — RAW JSONL grouped by “FILE: <name>.jsonl”; no fences.
  F140-53   MACHINE_CODE — plain code blocks starting “# File: <name>”; no fences.
  F140-54 Outside these three topics, parseable JSON and executable code are FORBIDDEN; use deconstructed examples.
  F140-55 Within the BCL, live executable code is prohibited except for RID machine headers and deconstructed examples/templates.
  F140-57 Enforcement: BCL violations = FAIL. Outside-BCL placement = WARN with relocation suggestion; do not block promotion solely for placement.

7. FENCES & EXAMPLES POLICY
  F140-60 Triple backticks are forbidden inside the three helper topics.
  F140-61 Fences may appear elsewhere only for non-executable, illustrative snippets.
  F140-62 In examples, use deconstructed tokens for rails/JSON/code; the literal “END OF RID:” may appear only when split/concatenated.
  F140-63 Safe deconstruction patterns:
           "RID"+": EXAMPLE-000"
           "TITLE"+": Example Only"
           "{"+"\"k\""+":"+"\"v\""+"}"
           "==== "+"[TOPIC: "+"<NAME>"+" | id="+"<ID>"+"]"+" ===="

8. GOVERNED HELPERS INDEX (RIDs LIST WHAT THEY GOVERN)
  F140-70 Any RID that governs helpers MUST include an index in its body enumerating each governed helper with fields:
           name, type∈{LINT,JSONL,CODE,DATA}, routed_topic∈{LINTER_RUNBOOK_RULES,SPECS_JSONL,MACHINE_CODE}, purpose, enforces:[IDs].
  F140-71 This index documents authority only; it does not substitute helper-side parentage.
  F140-72 Missing or stale entries in the index → FAIL at promotion.

9. HELPER PARENTAGE (DECLARED IN HELPERS)
  F140-80 All helpers MUST declare parentage in-place:
  F140-81 JSONL row fields include {"parent_rid":"<RID>"} and MAY include {"enforces":["F140-.."]}.
  F140-82 Lint blocks include a visible line “Governing Rule: <RID>” and MAY list “Enforces: <IDs>”.
  F140-83 Machine code begins with a header comment: # Parent RID: <RID> | Enforces: <IDs>.
  F140-84 Missing parentage → FAIL.

10. HELPER PLACEMENT WAYFINDER (EMBEDDED, DECONSTRUCTED)
  F140-90 This RID embeds the canonical wayfinder to show that the 4-line banner is one atomic header and that helpers belong strictly below the bottom rail.
  F140-91 Routed topics are those in §6. No helper content may appear between the top and bottom rails of any topic.
  F140-92 Embedded wayfinder (non-live; deconstructed, all four lines):
    "==== " + "<top rail reproduced as spaces>" + "===="
    "==== " + "[TOPIC: " + "<ROUTED_TOPIC_NAME>" + " | id=" + "<ROUTED_TOPIC_ID>" + "]" + " ===="
    "Purpose: " + "<topic purpose text>"
    "==== " + "<bottom rail reproduced as spaces>" + "===="
  F140-93 Lint scope: presence of §10 inside this RID is REQUIRED (LNT-WAYFINDER-401 for FMT-140). Reconstructing live rails inside any RID body is FORBIDDEN (LNT-WAYFINDER-402).

11. LINT HOOKS (AUTHORITATIVE INDEX)
  F140-100 Lint lives in LINTER_RUNBOOK_RULES and cites “Governing Rule: FMT-140”.
  F140-101 Required IDs include:
            LNT-RID-STYLE-001/002/011/021/031/032/041/042/051/061/071/081,
            LNT-META-GRAMMAR-201,
            LNT-XCHK-301/302/303/304,
            LNT-PLACEMENT-501,
            LNT-ENDPAD-601,
            LNT-NORMALIZE-701,
            LNT-LINTPAD-611/612,
            LNT-JSOLPAD-621/622,
            LNT-MCPAD-631/632,
            LNT-BCL-CODE-802,
            LNT-BCL-JSOL-803,
            LNT-ROUTING-820.
  F140-102 Spacing pads: lint blocks have one blank line above and exactly two below (LNT-LINTPAD-611/612).

12. SPECS (JSONL)
  F140-110 Specs governed by this RID live only in SPECS_JSONL.
  F140-111 Each FILE block MUST start with “FILE: <name>.jsonl”.
  F140-112 Each FILE block MUST contain ≥1 JSONL row; empty FILE → FAIL (LNT-BCL-JSOL-803).
  F140-113 Spacing: one blank line immediately above each FILE; exactly two blank lines below each FILE.
  F140-114 Specs MUST NOT create or modify topics, rails, categories, or machine headers without explicit consent.
  F140-115 “Declaration lines” include Template-Index entries that emit *.jsonl names; pad them per F140-113.

13. MACHINE CODE
  F140-120 Code lives only in MACHINE_CODE.
  F140-121 Each helper starts with “# File: <name>” and carries the Parent RID header comment per F140-83.
  F140-122 Spacing: one blank line immediately above each helper header; exactly two blank lines below the declaration line.
  F140-123 Helpers may verify and perform spacing-only autofix; no semantic edits without explicit consent (see COR-701).

14. CONSENT & NON-CREATION GUARANTEE
  F140-130 No RID, lint, spec, or code may create/modify topics, banners, categories, or machine headers without explicit user consent and visible NOTICE.
  F140-131 Absent consent, artifacts operate read-only: verify/lint/emit previews; no structural creation/edit.
  F140-132 Consent MUST be recorded in the Task Ledger before emission.

15. META & NORMALIZATION (RIDs THAT GOVERN HELPERS)
  F140-140 A META block is REQUIRED in RIDs that govern helpers; allowed keys and fixed order:
            refs, tags, emitted_files, hash, legacy_ok, notes, deprecation_map.
  F140-141 ASCII only; arrays use [ … ], comma+space; one key per line; no blank lines between keys. Wrong order/keys → FAIL (LNT-META-GRAMMAR-201).
  F140-142 Normalize to NFC, UTF-8, LF only. Tabs/ZW*/BOM/CRLF forbidden → FAIL (LNT-RID-STYLE-021).
  F140-143 Minified-body SHA1: drop blank lines; trim; collapse internal spaces; remove all spaces/newlines; hash UTF-8 bytes. META.hash records SHA1(minified_body) at promotion.

16. CROSS-CHECK, LEDGER, INTEGRITY, SIDECARS, FOLDS
  F140-150 Cross-check new/edited RIDs against {COR,FMT,FIH,LOG,LNT,FIT,SPECS,MACHINE_CODE}.
  F140-151 Fail codes:
            FMT140-XCHK-001 overlap without reference;
            FMT140-XCHK-002 weaker duplicate present;
            FMT140-XCHK-003 survivor missing backward enforcement;
            FMT140-XCHK-004 missing cross-check vs FMT-140.
  F140-152 Helper emissions MUST append a Task Ledger entry per COR-701 (timestamp, action, sha1s, ranges, operator, consent, validation).
  F140-153 Integrity chain recomputed at L3→L2 and L2→L1; mismatch → BLOCK (per COR-701).
  F140-154 Sidecars are export-only audit artifacts; never replace or modify in-diary content; not required for execution. If no export, no sidecars.
  F140-155 No alias maps on folds; update all references to the survivor; survivor must continue enforcing prior helper behaviors.

17. OUTPUTS (TEMPLATES & EMIT SLOTS)
  F140-160 OUTPUTS is the sole location for template declarations governed by this RID.
  F140-161 Template Index format:

RID: FIH-001
TITLE: FILE, INTEGRITY, AND HANDLING — DETERMINISTIC NAMING, PROMOTIONS, MANIFESTS, AND LINK CHECKS
CATEGORY: GOV / FILES
STATUS: ACTIVE
SHA1: <pending>

1. PURPOSE
  F001-01 Define deterministic rules for artifact naming, integrity verification, link delivery, and promotion flow across L3, L2, and L1.
  F001-02 Delegate all logging, KLOG, and retention mechanics to LOG-001.
  F001-03 Prevent file-not-found errors, stale preview confusion, and layer-write errors.

2. SCOPE
  F001-04 Applies to all emitted artifacts: canonical diaries, previews, data artifacts, and manifests.
  F001-05 Editing is permitted only in L3; L1 and L2 are read-only promotion targets.
  F001-06 Excludes logging schema and retention; see LOG-001.

3. DEFINITIONS
  F001-07 Artifact = any file emitted by Diary operations.
  F001-08 Version = v.mm.ggg.ddd with zero-padded mm(2), ggg(3), ddd(3).
  F001-09 Artifact Manifest = JSON with fields {mode, origin_layer, promotion_path, layer, op, window, anchors, pre_sha1, post_sha1, line_delta, rid_counts, links[], paths[], timestamp_local, timestamp_utc, tz_local, filename, full_path, size_bytes, mime_hint, version_parse:{mm,ggg,ddd}, collision_flag, write_mode, dst_token, link_echo}.
  F001-10 Origin Layer = the layer where an operation executes; valid value is L3 only.
  F001-11 Promotion Path = L3->L2 or L2->L1; reverse or lateral writes are forbidden.
  F001-12 User-Sourced Draft (USD) = any input whose basename starts with USER_ or USER_EDITS_; L3 intake only, never emitted as-is.
  F001-13 Preview (full Diary) = whole Diary with proposed edits in L3 for drift/context review.
  F001-14 Task Snippet = isolated extract of the exact changes performed in a task, plus proof metadata.

4. NAMING RULES
  F001-20 Canonical filename pattern: The_Prompt_Diaries_vmm.ggg.ddd_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_CET|CEST.txt
  F001-21 Canonical regex: ^The_Prompt_Diaries_v\d{2}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}_\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}_\d{2}-\d{2}_(CET|CEST)\.txt$
  F001-22 Preview filename pattern: PREVIEW_<TASK>_<IT>_The_Prompt_Diaries_vmm.ggg.ddd.txt
  F001-23 Preview regex: ^PREVIEW_[A-Z0-9_]{3,40}_\d{2}_The_Prompt_Diaries_v\d{2}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}\.txt$
  F001-24 Data filename pattern: DATA_<TASK>_The_Prompt_Diaries_vmm.ggg.ddd.txt
  F001-25 Data regex: ^DATA_[A-Z0-9_]{3,40}_The_Prompt_Diaries_v\d{2}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}\.txt$
  F001-26 Tokens: TASK=[A-Z0-9_]{3,40} (no leading/trailing underscore, no double underscores). IT=\d{2} (00–99).
  F001-27 ASCII only. No spaces. Use underscores as separators. Hyphens allowed only inside the timestamp.
  F001-28 Ad-hoc prefixes/suffixes outside patterns are forbidden.
  F001-29 Filename–header parity required; mismatch fails gates.
  F001-30 Preview filename (full Diary): PREVIEW_<TASK>_<IT>_The_Prompt_Diaries_vmm.ggg.ddd.txt
  F001-31 Task Snippet filename: TASK_SNIPPET_<TASK>_<IT>_The_Prompt_Diaries_vmm.ggg.ddd.txt
  F001-32 Regex (Task Snippet): ^TASK_SNIPPET_[A-Z0-9_]{3,40}_\d{2}_The_Prompt_Diaries_v\d{2}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}\.txt$

5. VERSION SEMANTICS
  F001-40 Version uses v.mm.ggg.ddd.
  F001-41 Governance promotion that changes governing content increments ggg and resets ddd=000 at L3->L2; this ggg persists to L1.
  F001-42 Data work never changes ggg; data operations may increment ddd only.
  F001-43 Rollback rule: ggg is authoritative for ordering; higher ggg supersedes any ddd.

6. LINK DELIVERY AND INTEGRITY
  F001-50 Each delivered artifact must include a clickable Markdown link with visible text equal to the exact filename.
  F001-51 Print SHA1 on the same line as the link.
  F001-52 Echo the raw filesystem path on the next line as plain text.
  F001-53 Click test: after emission, open the linked path read-only and verify readability.
  F001-54 Link text filename must match the link target basename byte-for-byte.
  F001-55 Failure of F001-50..F001-54 blocks promotion and delivery.

7. PATH AND STORAGE POLICY
  F001-60 Storage root is /mnt/data/.
  F001-61 No relative .. segments. No symlinks. Flat layout unless a task-specific subfolder is declared; subfolder names mirror TASK.
  F001-62 Max basename length 140 bytes. ASCII only.
  F001-63 Reserved characters forbidden: space, :, *, ?, ", <, >, |, \, and double dots.

8. WRITE SAFETY
  F001-70 Atomic write: write to a temp file in L3, fsync, then rename to the final name.
  F001-71 No overwrite: if the destination exists, fail with COLLISION.
  F001-72 Timestamp source for canonical filenames is Brussels local (CET/CEST); manifests record both local and UTC times.
  F001-73 Encoding must be UTF-8, Unicode NFC, LF newlines. CRLF forbidden.
  F001-74 L1/L2 write protection: open L1/L2 only read-only; creation or replacement occurs via promotion rename from L3.

9. INTEGRITY GATES
  F001-80 Artifact must exist, be readable, and size>0.
  F001-81 Compute SHA1 before and after content-affecting operations.
  F001-82 All referenced links must resolve at emission time.
  F001-83 Write-layer check: Origin Layer must be L3.
  F001-84 Target-layer check: any attempt to write to L1 or L2 fails with FORBIDDEN_LAYER_WRITE.
  F001-85 Parity check: filename version equals header version; mismatch fails.
  F001-86 Diff proof: record added, removed, moved line counts and windows touched; zero-delta fails with NO_CHANGE_BLOCK.
  F001-87 Task Snippet parity: snippet content must be a strict subset or exact diff representation of the paired Preview; mismatch fails.
  F001-88 Base proof: Preview and Snippet must record base canonical filename + SHA1.
  F001-89 Window proof: Snippet must list exact line ranges and topic ids touched.

10. PROMOTION GATES
  F001-90 Only promotions may create or replace L2 or L1 artifacts.
  F001-91 L3->L2 requires naming PASS, integrity PASS, clickable link PASS, manifest emitted, and pillar lints PASS (no FAIL).
  F001-92 L2->L1 requires all F001-91 gates plus stability attestation.
  F001-93 Direct edit detection: if an L1 or L2 SHA1 changes without a manifest citing a valid Promotion Path, emit TAMPER_DETECTED and halt.
  F001-94 After any task completes: emit Preview and Task Snippet before seeking promotion.
  F001-95 On promotion: emit the promoted canonical file in addition to Preview/Snippet; no extra consent needed to emit files.

11. USER-SOURCED DRAFTS
  F001-100 USD intake allowed as L3 inputs only; never emitted as-is.
  F001-101 Normalize USD to a Preview name on first touch; remove USER_* prefix; choose the next IT.
  F001-102 Manifest must include usd_source=true and usd_original_path.
  F001-103 Governance promotion from a USD follows F001-41 (ggg+1, ddd=000) at L3->L2; do not bump again at L2->L1.
  F001-104 Data-only USDs follow F001-42; do not change ggg.

12. PROCESS
  F001-110 Execute edits in L3 only.
  F001-111 Ensure exactly one active Preview per TASK × Version; new Previews supersede the prior one (and its Snippet).
  F001-112 Before delivering a Preview, compare SHA1 with the last delivered Preview; if equal, block as NO_CHANGE.
  F001-113 Emit a one-line delta summary: Δlines=+X/−Y; RIDs_touched=N; anchors_ok.
  F001-114 Promote L3->L2, then optionally L2->L1. No direct L3->L1.
  F001-115 After promotion, verify filename parity and SHA1 read-only, then print links.

13. IMMUTABILITY AND ROLLBACK
  F001-120 Canonical immutability: once emitted, canonical contents must not change; corrections require a new version per section 5.
  F001-121 Quarantine orphans: artifacts that fail section 4 or 5 are quarantined and not linked.
  F001-122 Superseded Previews must be archived and referenced once with SHA1.

14. PROHIBITIONS
  F001-130 No create/write/append/truncate in L1 or L2 by non-promotion operations.
  F001-131 No multiple manifests per operation.
  F001-132 No USER_* prefixes in emitted artifact names.
  F001-133 No alias maps or softlinks for artifacts.
  F001-134 No task completes without emitting both Preview and Task Snippet.

15. LINT
  F001-140 Enforce section 4 regexes against filenames; fail on mismatch.
  F001-141 Fail if any link line is missing, not clickable, or link text ≠ filename.
  F001-142 Fail if open/read test fails or size==0.
  F001-143 Fail if SHA1 not printed next to each link.
  F001-144 Fail if manifest.origin_layer ≠ L3 or promotion_path missing when destination is L2 or L1.
  F001-145 Fail on any write handle opened to L1 or L2.
  F001-146 Warn on MIME/extension mismatch.
  F001-147 Emit LINK_CHECK table in manifest for each delivered artifact.
  F001-148 Fail if Task Snippet lacks base canonical + SHA1, window ranges, or delta summary.
  F001-149 Fail if Snippet SHA1/diff does not correspond to the paired Preview.

16. HELPERS
  F001-150 Helper placement follows FMT-140 topics.
  F001-151 Linter rules live under LINTER — RUNBOOK & RULES and declare Governing Rule: FIH-001.
  F001-152 Specs JSONL live under SPECS (JSONL) and declare Governing Rule: FIH-001.
  F001-153 Machine-code checkers live under MACHINE CODE HELPERS and declare Governing Rule: FIH-001.
  F001-154 Helpers must assert L1/L2 read-only access during verification and perform promotion via atomic rename from L3.

17. META
  F001-160 refs: ["LOG-001","FMT-140","FMT-141","COR-700","COR-701"]

RID: FMT-141
TITLE: Topic Structure, WorkSurfaces, Sub-Work-Surfaces, Helpers, Folding
CATEGORY: FORMAT / STRUCTURE
STATUS: ACTIVE
SHA1: <populate at promotion>

============================================================
1. PURPOSE
============================================================
  F141-01 Define structural law for Topic headers, Topic header-blocks, WorkSurfaces, Topic_Body_Sub_Surfaces, Functional Sub-Work-Surfaces, END markers, metadata, helper-parenting, folding, and RID construction.
  F141-02 Ensure Topics and RIDs are deterministic, stable in their boundaries, helper-stable, and machine-parsable.
  F141-03 Replace legacy BODY-block architecture with a universal WorkSurface + TopicBodySWS + Functional Sub-Work-Surface system while preserving prior enforcement intent and functional outcomes, except where explicitly strengthened.
  F141-04 Provide structural guarantees for all governance, operational, and corpus Topics.

============================================================
2. SCOPE
============================================================
  F141-10 Applies to all RIDs.
  F141-11 Applies to all Topics within the Diary.
  F141-12 Applies to all helpers, lints, formatters, and structural tools.
  F141-13 Applies to append-only logging Topics and multi-block Topics.
  F141-14 Applies to RID folding and helper-parenting systems.

============================================================
3. DEFINITIONS
============================================================
  F141-20 Topic_Header_Block = contiguous four-line block: top rail, topic line, purpose line, bottom rail. This block is atomic and immutable.
  F141-21 WorkSurface = the closed interval of lines strictly between the bottom rail of the Topic_Header_Block and the matching END_TOPIC marker for the same id. The four header lines and the END_TOPIC line are not part of the WorkSurface.
  F141-22 Sub_Work_Surface = contiguous block of lines fully contained inside the WorkSurface, delimited by a SubSurfaceHeader and SubSurfaceFooter whose identifiers match exactly.
  F141-22A Topic_Body_Sub_Surface (TopicBodySWS) = the unique Sub_Work_Surface that wraps the full logical body of a Topic. It MUST use the identifier "<TOPIC-ID>-BODY" and MUST span from the first to the last non-blank line in the WorkSurface.
  F141-22B Functional_Sub_Work_Surface = any Sub_Work_Surface other than the TopicBodySWS. Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces group content by function (e.g., NOTES, PROFILES, DOMAINS, INDEX, LOG, DES001-NEW, LEGACY-DATA) and are the only zones where assistants and helpers may write.
  F141-23 SubSurfaceHeader = line with exact form: "[[SUB: " + "<TOPIC-ID>" + "-" + "<NAME>" + "]]".
  F141-24 SubSurfaceFooter = line with exact form: "[[/SUB: " + "<TOPIC-ID>" + "-" + "<NAME>" + "]]".
  F141-25 <TOPIC-ID> MUST match the Topic_Header_Block id exactly. <NAME> MUST be a unique ASCII slug within that Topic using [A–Z,a–z,0–9,_,-].
  F141-26 END_TOPIC marker = terminating Topic line with exact form "==== [END TOPIC | id=<TOPIC-ID>] ====" and id identical to Topic_Header_Block id.
  F141-27 END_RID marker = terminating RID line with exact form "END OF RID: <RID-ID>" where <RID-ID> matches the RID header.
  F141-28 META = RID metadata block.
  F141-29 Helper = deterministic external file that implements parent-RID structural behaviour.
  F141-30 Folding = consolidation of overlapping RIDs into a single survivor.
  F141-31 Wayfinder = non-normative structural diagram that may depict Topics, WorkSurfaces, TopicBodySWS, and Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces only in deconstructed (non-live) form.

============================================================
4. TOPIC HEADER BLOCK
============================================================
  F141-30 Each Topic MUST contain exactly one Topic_Header_Block.
  F141-31 Topic_Header_Block MUST consist of exactly four lines: top rail, topic line, purpose line, bottom rail.
  F141-32 Topic_Header_Block lines MUST NOT be altered without explicit user authorization.
  F141-33 No content MAY appear between any of the four Topic_Header_Block lines.
  F141-34 Topic line MUST use exact form: "==== [TOPIC: <NAME> | id=<ID>] ====".
  F141-35 Purpose line MUST use exact form: "Purpose: <short-text>".
  F141-36 ID in Topic_Header_Block MUST be unique within the Diary.
  F141-37 Topic_Header_Block MUST be treated as an indivisible atomic unit.
  F141-38 No assistant or helper MAY insert, rewrite, or delete any Topic_Header_Block line without explicit user authorization.
  F141-39 Topic rails MUST match width defined by FMT-140.
  F141-40 Assistants and helpers that render any Topic_Header_Block in output (including previews, summaries, or structural diagrams) MUST render all four lines of the Topic_Header_Block together. Rendering only a subset of these lines MUST be treated as a display error, even if the underlying Topic structure is valid.

============================================================
5. END MARKERS
============================================================
  F141-50 Each Topic MUST contain exactly one END_TOPIC marker.
  F141-51 END_TOPIC marker MUST use exact form: "==== [END TOPIC | id=<ID>] ====".
  F141-52 END_TOPIC id MUST match Topic_Header_Block id exactly.
  F141-53 No Topic content MAY appear after the END_TOPIC marker.
  F141-54 No assistant or helper MAY alter an END_TOPIC marker without explicit user authorization.
  F141-55 Each RID MUST terminate with a single-line RID footer.
  F141-56 The RID footer MUST use exact form: "END OF RID: <RID-ID>".
  F141-57 <RID-ID> in the RID footer MUST match the RID ID in the RID header exactly.
  F141-58 No RID content MAY appear after the RID footer line within the file.
  F141-59 Assistants and helpers MUST NOT create, modify, or remove RID footer lines without explicit user authorization.

============================================================
6. WORKSURFACE, TOPIC BODY, AND SUB-WORK-SURFACES
============================================================
  F141-60 Every Topic MUST contain exactly one WorkSurface (as defined in F141-21).
  F141-61 Every Topic MUST contain exactly one TopicBodySWS fully contained inside its WorkSurface. The TopicBodySWS MUST:
             a) use the identifier "<TOPIC-ID>-BODY"; and
             b) span from the first non-blank line in the WorkSurface to the last non-blank line in the WorkSurface.
  F141-62 All Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces for a Topic MUST be fully contained inside that Topic’s TopicBodySWS.
  F141-63 Sub_Work_Surface identifiers MUST be Topic-specific: "<TOPIC-ID>-<NAME>". <TOPIC-ID> MUST equal the Topic_Header_Block id. <NAME> MUST be unique within that Topic.
  F141-63A SubSurfaceHeader and SubSurfaceFooter lines MUST contain no characters other than the exact ASCII sequences defined in F141-23 and F141-24. No leading or trailing whitespace, no prefixes, and no suffixes are permitted.
  F141-63B SubSurfaceHeader and SubSurfaceFooter for a given "<TOPIC-ID>-<NAME>" MUST both lie within the same WorkSurface for that <TOPIC-ID>. Cross-WorkSurface or cross-Topic pairing is forbidden.
  F141-63C <NAME> MUST NOT begin or end with "-" or "_" and MUST NOT contain whitespace. Only the characters [A–Z,a–z,0–9,_,-] are permitted.
  F141-64 Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces MUST NOT overlap or nest each other. A WorkSurface line MAY belong simultaneously to:
             a) the TopicBodySWS; and
             b) at most one Functional_Sub_Work_Surface.
  F141-65 The SubSurfaceHeader of the TopicBodySWS MUST be the first non-blank line inside the WorkSurface. The SubSurfaceFooter of the TopicBodySWS MUST be the last non-blank line inside the WorkSurface. Blank lines MAY appear inside the TopicBodySWS but MUST NOT appear outside it within the WorkSurface.
  F141-66 Assistants and helpers MUST write only inside Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces. Writing directly in the WorkSurface outside the TopicBodySWS is forbidden. Writing directly inside the TopicBodySWS but outside any Functional_Sub_Work_Surface is forbidden for assistants and helpers.
  F141-67 Assistants and helpers MUST NOT insert, modify, or delete any of the four Topic_Header_Block lines, the END_TOPIC line, or any non-blank WorkSurface line that lies outside the TopicBodySWS.
  F141-68 Creation, renaming, or deletion of any Sub_Work_Surface header or footer lines (including the TopicBodySWS) MUST require explicit user authorization and MUST be treated as structural edits governed by COR-701.
  F141-69 Per-Topic rules MAY designate individual Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces as append-only, editable, or machine-only. Once declared, assistants and helpers MUST obey these local rules.
  F141-70 Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces that are designated append-only by their Topic definition MUST NOT be rewritten or merged. Allowed operations on such Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces are limited to:
             a) appending new lines at the bottom; and
             b) whitespace-only fixes explicitly authorised by the user.
  F141-71 All Sub_Work_Surfaces MUST be plain text only. Sub_Work_Surfaces MUST NOT contain executable code.
  F141-72 Sub_Work_Surfaces MUST NOT contain schemas, JSON, or JSONL rows. Any structured formats (schemas, JSONL, code) MUST live in Topics or blocks explicitly governed by other RIDs (e.g., SPECS_JSONL, MACHINE_CODE).
  F141-73 Legacy BODY-block semantics are preserved and strengthened as follows:
             a) any Topic that still contains a legacy BODY-block MUST treat that BODY-block as the TopicBodySWS for that Topic; and
             b) all constraints that applied to BODY-blocks in prior versions (append-only, no code, no schemas/JSON, fenced-only writing) now apply to all TopicBodySWS and Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces.

============================================================
7. MULTI-BLOCK TOPICS
============================================================
  F141-70 Topics MAY define multiple Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces within the same TopicBodySWS. Each Functional_Sub_Work_Surface SHOULD have a clear functional role (e.g., LOG, INDEX, NOTES, PROFILES, DOMAINS) documented in that Topic’s local schema or comments.
  F141-71 Topics that define multiple Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces MUST NOT contain any non-blank WorkSurface content outside the TopicBodySWS, and the TopicBodySWS MUST NOT contain any non-blank text that lies outside a Functional_Sub_Work_Surface, except for comments and section separators explicitly allowed by the governing Topic or RID.
  F141-72 Functional_Sub_Work_Surface names SHOULD reflect their role (e.g., "<TOPIC-ID>-LOG", "<TOPIC-ID>-INDEX", "<TOPIC-ID>-NOTES", "<TOPIC-ID>-DES-001-GLOBAL") while obeying the identifier rules in F141-63.
  F141-73 Assistants MUST write only inside the specific Functional_Sub_Work_Surface designated for the task when the Topic defines separate Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces for different purposes.
  F141-74 Structural tools MAY rely on Functional_Sub_Work_Surface naming patterns to route logs, indexes, and machine-readable regions, but MUST NOT infer behaviour beyond what the parent Topic and parent RID define.
  F141-75 Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces MUST group content by function, not by individual row. A RID or helper that writes rows for a given function (e.g., poses, lighting descriptors, symbolic profiles) MUST use a shared Functional_Sub_Work_Surface for that function instead of creating one Sub_Work_Surface per row or per tiny fragment.

============================================================
8. TOPIC STRUCTURE PROTECTION
============================================================
  F141-80 Assistants MUST NOT create new Topics without explicit user authorization.
  F141-81 Assistants MUST NOT delete Topics.
  F141-82 Assistants MUST NOT rename Topic ids.
  F141-83 Assistants MUST NOT move Topic boundaries.
  F141-84 Assistants MUST NOT insert rails, Topic header lines, or END_TOPIC markers.
  F141-85 Topic structure (Topic_Header_Block, WorkSurface extent, END_TOPIC) MUST remain stable across edits, except when explicitly modified under COR-701 structural gates.
  F141-86 Topic detection MUST rely on exact id matches.

============================================================
9. CROSS-RID STRUCTURAL BOUNDARIES
============================================================
  F141-90 RIDs MUST NOT rely on another RID for their operative meaning.
  F141-91 RIDs MAY reference another RID only for provenance.
  F141-92 RIDs MUST NOT import behaviour from other RIDs.
  F141-93 Structural domains MUST remain independent: FMT for formatting, LOG for logging, COR for consent, ANS for answer governance, other domain RIDs for their own behaviour.
  F141-94 Structural conflicts MUST be resolved by the following priority:
             a) FMT-140 governs formatting,
             b) FMT-141 governs Topic and RID structure,
             c) LOG-001 governs logging,
             d) COR-701 governs consent,
             e) domain RID governs its own domain behaviour.
  F141-95 No RID MAY override FMT-141 Topic or RID structure rules.

============================================================
10. RID STRUCTURE & ATOMICITY
============================================================
  F141-110 Each RID MUST consist of PURPOSE, SCOPE, structural sections, a WAYFINDER section, and META.
  F141-111 RID sections MUST appear in ascending numeric order.
  F141-112 Clause numbering within a RID SHOULD be continuous and strictly increasing within each major section. Where legacy numbering conflicts exist, new clauses MUST NOT create ambiguity about which text is operative and SHOULD avoid reusing existing clause numbers.
  F141-113 Each clause MUST contain exactly one atomic instruction.
  F141-114 Lists MAY be used only if all bullets implement one atomic requirement.
  F141-115 RID text MUST be ASCII-only.
  F141-116 RID text MUST NOT contain JSONL, schemas, code, or templates.
  F141-117 RID text MUST NOT contain executable logic.
  F141-118 RID MUST be structurally self-sufficient: no external documents required for interpretation of obligations, aside from non-normative Wayfinder diagrams governed by F141-230..F141-239.
  F141-119 The WAYFINDER section of a RID MUST follow the non-normative diagram rules in Section 15 and MUST be treated as descriptive only; all binding obligations MUST live in the main RID sections, not in Wayfinder diagrams.

============================================================
11. META RULES
============================================================
  F141-130 META MUST contain refs, tags, emitted_files, hash, legacy_ok, notes.
  F141-131 META.refs MUST NOT create behavioural dependencies.
  F141-132 META.tags MUST be descriptive single tokens.
  F141-133 META MUST NOT contain structured schemas.
  F141-134 META MUST NOT require external files for the RID to be operative.

============================================================
12. HELPER-PARENTING
============================================================
  F141-150 Helpers MUST declare their parent RID.
  F141-151 Helpers MUST NOT modify RID body text.
  F141-152 Helpers MUST NOT redefine rails, Topic headers, END markers, WorkSurface bounds, TopicBodySWS fences, or Functional_Sub_Work_Surface fences.
  F141-153 Helpers MUST operate only within their declared interface.
  F141-154 Helpers MUST NOT create new Topics or Sub_Work_Surfaces.
  F141-155 Helpers MUST NOT import code into RIDs.
  F141-156 Helpers MUST be rebuildable from parent RID text alone.
  F141-157 Helpers MUST NOT expand parent RID behaviour beyond what is defined in the RID.

============================================================
13. RID_CHANGE ARTIFACTS
============================================================
  F141-170 Any RID modification MUST generate at least one RID_CHANGE artifact.
  F141-171 For each RID modification, assistants and helpers operating in an interactive environment (e.g., chat) MUST emit:
             a) a RID_CHANGE artifact rendered in a plain-text codeblock that contains RID_CHANGE header fields and change_summary; and
             b) a RID_CHANGE artifact written to a plain-text file on disk using an implementation-defined path and a filename that includes the RID id and version (e.g., "RID_CHANGE_<RID-ID>_<VERSION>.txt").
  F141-172 The on-disk RID_CHANGE text file MUST contain:
             a) the full RID_CHANGE header (RID_CHANGE id, VERSION, TIMESTAMP, AUTHOR);
             b) the complete change_summary (including strictness_diff); and
             c) an old_body section that contains the full prior RID text body for the modified RID, in plain ASCII, followed by an "END OF RID_CHANGE: <RID-ID>" footer line.
  F141-173 The interactive RID_CHANGE codeblock artifact MUST contain:
             a) the RID_CHANGE header (RID_CHANGE id, VERSION, TIMESTAMP, AUTHOR); and
             b) the complete change_summary (including strictness_diff);
           and MUST NOT embed the full old RID body. The codeblock MAY instead refer to the old_body via a reference to the on-disk RID_CHANGE text file or to the source RID file.
  F141-174 RID_CHANGE artifacts (both on-disk files and codeblocks) MUST be append-only, deterministic, and ASCII-only.
  F141-175 RID_CHANGE artifacts MUST NOT contain executable code or JSON. List-like structures MUST be plain text only.
  F141-176 RID_CHANGE artifacts MUST be produced before promotion of the modified RID body to L1.
  F141-177 RID modifications MUST preserve prior obligations, enforcement stance, and effective functional outcome unless an explicit governance decision is made to relax, replace, or invert them. Such decisions MUST be recorded clearly in RID_CHANGE.change_summary.
  F141-178 If any obligation is weakened, removed, or inverted, RID_CHANGE.change_summary MUST include a strictness_diff subsection that enumerates:
               a) clauses that became stricter,
               b) clauses that stayed equivalent, and
               c) clauses that became weaker or were removed.
           COR-701 non-regression checks apply to this comparison.
  F141-179 RID_CHANGE artifacts themselves are not subject to RID_CHANGE; they are append-only logs. Subsequent modifications to the same RID MUST generate new RID_CHANGE artifacts that refer back to the immediately prior RID body, not to prior RID_CHANGE artifacts.

============================================================
14. FOLDING SYSTEM
============================================================
  F141-200 RID overlap occurs when two RIDs govern the same domain, process, or structural responsibility.
  F141-201 Folding MUST absorb all overlapping intent from the folded RIDs into the survivor RID.
  F141-202 Folding MUST NOT drop any obligations from the folded RIDs.
  F141-203 Folding MUST NOT introduce new behaviour; adding obligations is a separate governance edit.
  F141-204 Survivor selection MUST follow:
               a) RID with broader scope survives,
               b) if equal scope → most recently refactored RID survives,
               c) if still equal → user decision required.
  F141-205 Folded RIDs become archival metadata only.
  F141-206 Survivor RIDs MUST present one continuous clause numbering sequence after folding.
  F141-207 Helpers attached to folded RIDs MUST be rebound to the survivor RID.
  F141-208 META of survivor RID MUST contain folded_from field listing absorbed RIDs.
  F141-209 Folding operations MUST be logged via RID_CHANGE artifacts.
  F141-210 Folding MUST NOT modify file-level formatting; FMT-140 governs formatting concerns.
  F141-211 Folding MUST preserve the effective functional outcome and enforcement stance of the folded RIDs in the survivor, except where this would directly conflict with a stricter constraint added in the survivor.
  F141-212 In any conflict between legacy behaviour and a new stricter constraint inside the survivor, the stricter constraint prevails. The replaced legacy behaviour MUST be described explicitly in RID_CHANGE.change_summary and, where relevant, in META.notes.

============================================================
15. WAYFINDER RULES
============================================================
  F141-230 Wayfinder MUST be non-normative and informative only.
  F141-231 Wayfinder MUST NOT contain executable patterns or code.
  F141-232 Wayfinder MUST NOT reuse live Topic headers or END markers verbatim.
  F141-233 Wayfinder MUST NOT be used as a template for header generation.
  F141-234 Wayfinder MUST NOT carry ACTIVE structural rules; only diagrams and non-binding annotations are allowed.
  F141-235 Wayfinder MAY contain structural diagrams for navigation only.
  F141-236 Wayfinder consumers MUST reject lines that are similar to but not identical to valid headers or END markers.
  F141-237 Wayfinder updates MUST be logged via RID_CHANGE when structural diagrams change.
  F141-238 Every RID that governs or constrains one or more Topics MUST include a dedicated WAYFINDER section that provides non-normative structural diagrams for all Topics, TopicBodySWS, and Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces that the RID expects assistants or helpers to interact with. Each diagram MUST, at minimum, show:
             a) the Topic id;
             b) the TopicBodySWS identifier ("<TOPIC-ID>-BODY"); and
             c) the list of Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces for that Topic, grouped by function (e.g., NOTES, PROFILES, DOMAINS, INDEX, LOG, DES001-NEW, LEGACY-DATA).
  F141-239 When a RID introduces, removes, or modifies any Topic structure, WorkSurface bounds, TopicBodySWS, or Functional_Sub_Work_Surface layout (including creation, deletion, renaming, or relocation of Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces), the WAYFINDER section for that RID MUST show clearly labelled "before" and "after" diagrams for each affected Topic. These diagrams MUST:
             a) explicitly depict the hierarchy "Topic_Header_Block → TopicBodySWS → Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces"; and
             b) be kept in sync with the structural edits described in the RID body and in RID_CHANGE.change_summary.
           Lints and helpers MUST treat any mismatch between Wayfinder diagrams and actual structure as a structural error governed by COR-701.
  F141-240 Domain RIDs that create or own Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces inside a host Topic (e.g., DES-001 inside CORPUS, SYM-001 inside CONFIG_PROFILES) MUST:
             a) declare, in their WAYFINDER, the host Topic id;
             b) declare the TopicBodySWS identifier they expect (e.g., "CORPUS-BODY", "CFG-BODY");
             c) declare each Functional_Sub_Work_Surface name that the RID writes to or reads from; and
             d) indicate, for each Functional_Sub_Work_Surface, whether it is append-only, editable, or read-only for helpers.
           Other RIDs and helpers that extend the same Topic MUST follow this declared hierarchy and MUST NOT create Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces outside the host Topic’s TopicBodySWS.

============================================================
16. SAFETY RULES
============================================================
  F141-260 Assistants MUST NOT modify Topic structure except within Functional_Sub_Work_Surfaces and only as allowed by the governing Topic and RIDs.
  F141-261 Assistants MUST NOT write between the Topic_Header_Block and the TopicBodySWS header inside the WorkSurface.
  F141-262 Assistants MUST NOT write between the TopicBodySWS footer and the END_TOPIC marker.
  F141-263 Assistants MUST NOT create new rails, Topic headers, END_TOPIC markers, or END_RID markers.
  F141-264 Assistants MUST NOT remove rails, Topic headers, END_TOPIC markers, or END_RID markers.
  F141-265 Assistants MUST apply LOG-001 for all logging operations.
  F141-266 Assistants MUST apply COR-701 for all consent-bound operations.

RID: COR-701
TITLE: Deterministic Edit Process, Gates, and Manifests
CATEGORY: CONTROL / PROCESS
STATUS: ACTIVE
VERSION: 4.5
SHA1: <pending>

============================================================
1. PURPOSE
============================================================
  C701-01 Define deterministic micro-steps for L3 edits and gated promotion to L2/L1.
  C701-02 Prevent rail damage, scope creep, concurrency races, and nondeterminism.
  C701-03 Require verifiable Manifests, integrity proof, and gate outcomes for every governed Step and Batch.
  C701-04 Provide a deterministic contract for helpers and assistants that perform Governance edits under COR-701.

============================================================
2. SCOPE
============================================================
  C701-10 Applies to Governance (BCL) Topic bodies only.
  C701-11 Corpus/Ark/Data Topics are excluded from Governance editing under this RID unless explicitly whitelisted by a future RID.
  C701-12 Assistants MUST operate at temperature 0 for all COR-701-governed Steps and Batches.
  C701-13 COR-701 governs only edit process, gates, and Manifests. Topic and RID structure remain governed by FMT-140 and FMT-141.
  C701-14 COR-701 applies equally to single-Step operations and batched micro-Step sequences that target Governance Topics.

============================================================
3. DEFINITIONS
============================================================
  C701-20 Step = single targeted replace/insert/delete within one Topic body Window in a Governance Topic.
  C701-21 Window = inclusive [start,end] line interval for a Step strictly below the Topic bottom rail and above the END_TOPIC marker for the same id. For Topics structured per FMT-141, the Window MUST be fully contained inside the Topic WorkSurface and inside a Functional_Sub_Work_Surface that permits COR-701 edits.
  C701-22 Block = contiguous run of non-blank lines inside the Window that share the same routing/rail context (no rails, no Topic header lines, no END_TOPIC lines, no SubSurfaceHeader/Footer lines).
  C701-22A L3 Diary artifact = any file used by COR-701 as an L3 workspace or PREVIEW for a Governance Topic. An L3 Diary artifact MUST be a complete Diary file containing structurally valid Topic_Header_Blocks, WorkSurfaces, END_TOPIC markers, and END_RID markers, and MUST NOT be a snippet or partial extract.
  C701-23 Manifest = deterministic plain-text or JSON-like object that records pre/post SHA1, Window coordinates, line deltas, Block counts, gate outcomes, lint results, and artifacts for a Step or Batch. Manifest fields are specified in Section 10.
  C701-24 KLOG = one-line AUTO-KLOG entry per FIH-001 for promotions, file operations, and integrity-chain events.
  C701-25 Integrity chain = hash chain over successive SHA1s per Step, Batch, and promotion, such that each link commits to the previous link and current content SHA1.
  C701-26 Batch = ordered list of Steps {step_1, step_2, …, step_n} targeting a single Governance Topic and a single file, executed sequentially under one Batch Plan.
  C701-27 Batch Plan = pre-declared structure that describes the intended Steps in a Batch, including Topic id, file path, expected Step count, and a Window and operation type for each Step.
  C701-28 HALT Manifest = Manifest variant that records failure of a Step or Batch, the applicable error codes, and the reason/evidence for the halt.
  C701-29 Link (for gate checks) = internal reference inside the Diary (Topic ids, anchors, Sub_Work_Surface ids, helper references) that MUST resolve without network access. External HTTP/HTTPS URLs are not Links for the purpose of C701-58.

============================================================
4. RAILS & BOUNDS
============================================================
  C701-30 No Step or Batch MAY change Topic rails, Topic_Header_Block lines, or END_TOPIC lines without explicit user consent outside COR-701. Structural changes MUST be handled as separate structural edits governed by COR-701 gates and FMT-141.
  C701-31 Exactly one Block MAY be targeted per Step. All bytes outside the Window MUST match the preimage content for the file.
  C701-32 Multi-Window work MUST be decomposed into multiple Steps or Batches. A single Step MUST NOT span disjoint Windows.
  C701-33 For Topics structured per FMT-141, Steps MUST NOT modify SubSurfaceHeader or SubSurfaceFooter lines for any Sub_Work_Surface, including the TopicBodySWS, unless explicitly authorised as a structural edit.

============================================================
5. MICRO-STEPS (SINGLE STEP EXECUTION)
============================================================
  C701-40 Locate the canonical L3 Diary file for the Governance Topic using the system’s L3 Diary naming convention. The resolved file MUST satisfy C701-22A.
  C701-41 Identify the target Topic by id inside the file; compute pre_sha1 over the full file contents.
  C701-42 Resolve exact Window line indices for the Step; assert rails intact; assert exactly one Block targeted within the Window; assert that the Window lies entirely inside the allowed Governance Functional_Sub_Work_Surface where applicable.
  C701-43 Before applying the edit, re-read the current file and assert that its SHA1 equals pre_sha1. If mismatch is detected, the Step MUST FAIL with a concurrency-related error code and MUST NOT be applied.
  C701-44 Apply the edit inside the Window; compute post_sha1 over the full file; compute line_delta for the Step.
  C701-45 Validate outside-Window byte equality and all declared sentinels. Any mismatch MUST cause Step failure.
  C701-46 Emit a Step Manifest with all required fields (Section 10) and gate outcomes; append to the Task Ledger in workspace mode.
  C701-47 On any validation failure, gate failure, or Manifest construction failure, the helper MUST revert to the original bytes and HALT the Step. No partial success is permitted under COR-701.

============================================================
6. GATES (MUST PASS)
============================================================
  C701-50 anchors_present: all declared anchors and Topic ids for the Step MUST be locatable and unambiguous in the target file.
  C701-51 window_matches_plan: the resolved Window MUST match the planned Window or a justified, declared adjustment in the Manifest.
  C701-52 rails_untouched_outside_window: Topic rails, Topic_Header_Block lines, END_TOPIC lines, and any FMT-141 structural fences MUST remain unchanged outside the Window.
  C701-53 exactly_one_block_targeted: exactly one Block (as defined in C701-22) MUST be modified within the Window.
  C701-54 filename_canonical_and_openable: the file path MUST be canonical according to the system’s Diary naming conventions and MUST be readable and writable at Step time.
  C701-55 pre_sha1_captured: pre_sha1 MUST be computed over the full file before any modification attempts and recorded in the Manifest.
  C701-56 post_sha1_captured: post_sha1 MUST be computed over the full file after the edit, and the Manifest MUST record it.
  C701-57 line_delta_equals_expected: line_delta MUST match the expected change or have an explicit justification recorded in the Manifest.
  C701-58 all_links_resolvable: all internal Links (C701-29) referenced by the Step MUST resolve within the Diary. External HTTP/HTTPS URLs MUST NOT be included in this gate.
  C701-59 manifest_written_and_path_returned: the Manifest for the Step MUST be written to disk and its path recorded in the Task Ledger.
  C701-60 current_file_matches_preimage: immediately before applying the Step, the helper MUST assert that the current file SHA1 equals pre_sha1. If not, the Step MUST FAIL with a concurrency error code and HALT.

============================================================
7. PREVIEW → PROMOTION
============================================================
  C701-70 After each successful Step, the system MUST either:
             a) update the designated “current L3” Diary file for the Governance Topic; or
             b) emit a new L3 PREVIEW Diary snapshot named according to the system’s L3 Diary naming convention.
           In all cases, the resulting L3 Diary artifact MUST satisfy C701-22A.
  C701-71 On explicit approval, an L3 PREVIEW MAY be promoted to L2. Promotion MUST:
             a) mirror the L3 content into the L2 file;
             b) record a KLOG entry; and
             c) extend the integrity chain with the new SHA1 and promotion event.
  C701-72 L2→L1 promotion MUST require stability (no pending Steps) and explicit user consent. Each L2→L1 promotion MUST record:
             a) a KLOG entry;
             b) an integrity-chain link; and
             c) a promotion Manifest referencing the Steps and Batches that led to the L1 state.
  C701-73 L3 workspace content MAY be updated by successive Steps and Batches under COR-701. If a system emits timestamped or versioned L3 PREVIEW snapshot files, each snapshot MUST:
             a) be a complete Diary file as per C701-22A; and
             b) be treated as immutable once written.
           Subsequent Steps MUST produce new PREVIEW snapshots or update the designated “current L3” workspace Diary file, but MUST NOT rewrite prior snapshot files in place.

============================================================
8. LINT & CONSISTENCY
============================================================
  C701-80 Before any promotion from L3→L2 or L2→L1, lint suites referenced by FMT-140 and the relevant Topic RIDs MUST be executed.
  C701-81 Lint MUST FAIL on spacing, header, routing, or Topic/RID structure violations.
  C701-82 Lint results (pass/fail, suite names, and key findings) MUST be recorded in the promotion Manifest and, where available, in the Step or Batch Manifest.
  C701-83 Promotion MUST NOT proceed if any mandatory lint suite fails. Such failures MUST be reported via an appropriate error code.

============================================================
9. HELPER PLACEMENT WAYFINDER SCHEMA (NORMATIVE)
============================================================
  C701-90 Helpers that need to render a deconstructed Topic header for placement or orientation MUST use the following exact non-live schema for display only:
             "==== " + "<top rail reproduced as spaces>" + "===="
             "==== " + "[TOPIC: " + "<ROUTED_TOPIC_NAME>" + " | id=" + "<ROUTED_TOPIC_ID>" + "]" + " ===="
             "Purpose: " + "<topic purpose text>"
             "==== " + "<bottom rail reproduced as spaces>" + "===="
  C701-91 The Helper Placement Wayfinder schema in C701-90 MUST NOT be interpreted as a live Topic header or END marker. It is a rendering aid only. Live Topic headers and END markers remain governed by FMT-140 and FMT-141.

============================================================
10. MANIFEST FORMAT (REQUIRED FIELDS)
============================================================
  C701-100 Step and Batch Manifests MUST include at least:
               mode, op, topic_id, file_path, start, end, anchors_ok, rails_ok,
               pre_sha1, post_sha1, line_delta, block_counts:{before,after},
               gates_passed:[list], gates_failed:[list], error_codes:[list],
               artifacts:[paths], lint_results:[summary], timestamp, tz, operator.
  C701-101 Manifests MUST be ASCII-only and deterministic for the same input state and edit operations. Variable fields such as timestamp and tz MAY differ across runs but MUST NOT affect pre_sha1, post_sha1, or integrity-chain behaviour.
  C701-102 Batch Manifests MUST additionally include:
               batch_id, step_count, planned_steps:[{step_index, planned_window, planned_op}],
               executed_steps:[{step_index, status, error_codes}],
               first_step_pre_sha1, last_step_post_sha1.

============================================================
11. OUTSIDE-WINDOW GUARD
============================================================
  C701-110 Outside-Window bytes MUST match the preimage content exactly; any mismatch MUST cause Step failure with error code C701-G04.
  C701-111 Declared sentinels inside or adjacent to the Window MUST match pre- and post-conditions as defined in the Step plan. Sentinel mismatch MUST cause Step failure.

============================================================
12. REVERSIONS
============================================================
  C701-120 On any FAIL (gate failure, lint failure, Manifest failure, or outside-Window mismatch), the helper MUST restore the original bytes for the file from the preimage committed by pre_sha1.
  C701-121 On FAIL, the helper MUST emit a HALT Manifest including:
               a) the failing Step or Batch id;
               b) the gates that failed;
               c) the error_codes triggered; and
               d) evidence for the failure (e.g., mismatched hashes, line ranges).
  C701-122 Retries are permitted only after the failure cause is understood and addressed. Retrying without addressing the cause violates COR-701 and MUST be treated as an operational error.

============================================================
13. SIDECARS & EXPORT
============================================================
  C701-130 Sidecars (helper-generated files, reports, diagrams) are optional and export-only. No execution path or Governance obligation MAY depend on a sidecar file.
  C701-131 No sidecar MAY replace, modify, or mask in-diary content. Sidecars MUST be clearly separated by path and filename from live Diary files.
  C701-132 Sidecars MAY summarise Manifests and gate outcomes, but the Manifests themselves remain the canonical record.

============================================================
14. NON-REGRESSION
============================================================
  C701-140 COR-701 constraints MUST NOT be weakened, removed, or inverted without an explicit waiver decision and a RID_CHANGE artifact as defined in FMT-141.
  C701-141 When COR-701 is amended, clause sets and enforcement stance MUST be compared to the prior version. If any effective constraint becomes weaker, the change MUST be logged as a weakening in RID_CHANGE.strictness_diff and MUST require explicit Governance approval.
  C701-142 In any conflict between a legacy interpretation and a stricter new clause in COR-701, the stricter clause prevails unless a specific waiver is recorded.

============================================================
15. DISCLOSURE & RID-SCAN NOTICE
============================================================
  C701-150 Every Governance reply that performs or proposes edits under COR-701 MUST include a RID-scan notice and gate outcomes summary.
  C701-151 The RID-scan notice MUST include a canonical one-line summary of the form:
               "RID-COR-701: <STATUS> gates=[<list>] errors=[<list>]"
           where <STATUS> is PASS or FAIL, <list> entries are numeric gate ids (e.g., 50,51,52), and error codes are the C701-Gxx codes triggered.
  C701-152 When no COR-701-governed edits are performed or proposed in a reply, the assistant MAY omit the RID-COR-701 notice or MAY emit:
               "RID-COR-701: N/A (no governed edits)".

============================================================
16. ERROR CODES AND GATE MAPPING
============================================================
  C701-160 Error codes used in COR-701 Manifests and HALT Manifests MUST include at least:
             C701-G01 anchors_missing
             C701-G02 multi_window_attempt
             C701-G03 rails_modified
             C701-G04 byte_diff_outside_window
             C701-G05 manifest_incomplete
             C701-G06 filename_noncanonical
             C701-G07 lint_fail
             C701-G08 concurrency_mismatch
  C701-161 Gate failures MUST map to error codes as follows (minimum mapping):
             anchors_present                    → C701-G01
             window_matches_plan                → C701-G02
             rails_untouched_outside_window     → C701-G03
             exactly_one_block_targeted         → C701-G02
             filename_canonical_and_openable    → C701-G06
             pre_sha1_captured                  → C701-G05
             post_sha1_captured                 → C701-G05
             line_delta_equals_expected         → C701-G05
             all_links_resolvable               → C701-G05
             manifest_written_and_path_returned → C701-G05
             current_file_matches_preimage      → C701-G08
  C701-162 If multiple gates fail, Manifests MUST record all failing gates and all corresponding error codes, with one primary error code identified where necessary.
  C701-163 Lint failures MUST use C701-G07, with suite names and summaries recorded in lint_results.

============================================================
17. BATCH EXECUTION
============================================================
  C701-170 A Batch MUST operate on a single Governance Topic and a single canonical file path.
  C701-171 Batch execution MUST be sequential. Each Step in the Batch MUST see the previous Step’s post_sha1 as its pre_sha1.
  C701-172 A Batch MUST begin with a Batch Plan Manifest that declares:
               a) Topic id and canonical file path;
               b) expected Step count;
               c) for each Step: step_index, planned Window, planned op type;
               d) any declared sentinels or Links used across Steps.
  C701-173 For each Step in a Batch, all single-Step gates (Section 6) MUST be applied. A Batch MAY introduce additional Batch-level gates but MUST NOT weaken any Step-level gates.
  C701-174 On first gate failure, concurrency mismatch, or outside-Window mismatch in a Batch:
               a) the failing Step MUST revert;
               b) remaining Steps in the Batch MUST NOT execute; and
               c) a Batch HALT Manifest MUST be emitted.
  C701-175 Batch completion MUST produce a Batch Manifest that lists, for each Step:
               {step_index, status=PASS/FAIL, error_codes, pre_sha1, post_sha1, Window}.
  C701-176 Helpers and assistants MUST NOT silently split or merge Batches without updating the Batch Plan Manifest and informing the operator.

============================================================
18. ASSISTANT BEHAVIOUR (GOVERNED STEPS)
============================================================
  C701-180 A governed assistant MUST treat COR-701 as binding for any edit to Governance Topic bodies.
  C701-181 A governed assistant MUST NOT perform a Governance edit under COR-701 without producing a valid Step or Batch Manifest and passing all mandatory gates C701-50..C701-60.
  C701-182 Once a Batch Plan is explicitly approved by the user, the assistant MAY execute the Batch Steps without per-Step user confirmation, subject to all gates, lint, and revert rules.
  C701-183 A governed assistant MUST surface, in its reply, a summary of:
               a) Steps and Batches executed;
               b) gates passed/failed; and
               c) any HALT conditions encountered.
  C701-184 If an assistant or helper cannot satisfy COR-701 requirements (e.g., cannot locate the canonical file, cannot resolve the Topic id, cannot construct a complete Manifest, or cannot run required lint), it MUST refuse the edit, emit a HALT Manifest with the appropriate error code, and report the refusal to the operator instead of attempting a best-effort edit.
  C701-185 Assistants MUST NOT ignore or silently bypass COR-701. Any Governance edit performed without COR-701 gates and Manifests is non-compliant.

============================================================
19. INTERACTIVE REPLY SHAPE (CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS)
============================================================
  C701-190 In an interactive environment (e.g., chat), a governed assistant that performs or proposes a COR-701-governed edit MUST NOT return only the new Block content without clear structural context.
  C701-191 For each governed Step or Batch, the assistant’s reply MUST provide at least one of the following:
             a) a full Topic view for the affected Topic (Topic_Header_Block, WorkSurface with the edit applied, END_TOPIC); or
             b) a deterministic patch representation in a codeblock that includes:
                  - topic_id,
                  - file_path,
                  - Window [start,end] line indices,
                  - the pre-edit Block (old_block),
                  - the post-edit Block (new_block).
  C701-192 Patch representations MUST include enough anchoring to be mechanically applicable without guesswork. At minimum, the patch MUST specify the Window [start,end] and MUST correspond exactly to the bytes that will change under the Step Manifest.
  C701-193 Replies that contain only a free-floating Block with no file_path, topic_id, Window, or before/after context violate COR-701 and MUST NOT be emitted for governed edits.
  C701-194 When reply length constraints prevent returning a full Topic view, assistants SHOULD prefer the deterministic patch form in C701-191(b) and MUST still emit the Step or Batch Manifest so that tools can apply the edit in context.

============================================================
21. RELATIONS
============================================================
  C701-210 COR-701 references but does not depend on:
               FIH-001 for filename and KLOG conventions,
               FMT-140 for formatting and routing,
               FMT-141 for Topic and RID structure,
               COR-700 for integrity stance,
               LOG-001 for logging behaviour.
  C701-211 In case of conflict between structural rules, the priority order is:
               a) FMT-140 for formatting,
               b) FMT-141 for Topic and RID structure,
               c) COR-700 for integrity stance,
               d) COR-701 for governed edit process,
               e) domain-specific RIDs for domain behaviour.

============================================================
22. WAYFINDER (NON-NORMATIVE)

  C701-220 The following diagram is descriptive only and illustrates typical COR-701 flows:

    [Topic (Governance)]
      └─ WorkSurface
          └─ Functional_Sub_Work_Surface (governance-edit zone)
              └─ Step (single Window edit)
                   ├─ Gates C701-50..C701-60
                   ├─ Manifest (pre/post SHA1, Window, gates, lint)

END OF RID: COR-701









RID: ANS-001
TITLE: ANSWER GOVERNANCE, WORK MODES, SESSION ANCHOR, AND ANSWER FRAME (BLUEPRINT-ALIGNED)
CATEGORY: CONTROL / DELIVERY
STATUS: DRAFT (L3)
SHA1: <pending>

============================================================
1. PURPOSE
============================================================
  A001-01 Define one machine-enforceable answer governance system for OUTSIDE replies.
  A001-02 Align answer behaviour with the revised Answer Structure blueprint (14 sections) while preserving legacy intent.
  A001-03 Separate WORK MODES from OPERATION TYPES and attach Answer Frame behaviour only to WORK MODES.
  A001-04 Govern the BRAINSTORM workspace behaviour (non-structured, non-deterministic) from this RID without placing RIDs inside that topic.
  A001-05 Ensure deterministic behaviour (temperature=0) for governed modes; define explicit exceptions.
  A001-06 Guarantee that at most one WORK MODE is active at any time; if mode classification is uncertain, default to STRICT.
  A001-07 Enable safe future growth via clause ID ranges, Answer Frame variants, and deterministic patch schemas.
  A001-08 Bind Answer Frame Session Anchor behaviour to canonical Session State defined by LOG-001 without importing logging or schema semantics into ANS-001.
  A001-09 Preserve a clear separation of concerns: ANS-001 governs behaviour and frames; LOG-001 governs logging and session state; FMT-141 governs Topic and boundary structure.

============================================================
2. SCOPE
============================================================
  A001-20 Applies to OUTSIDE responses claimed under WORK MODES whose Answer Frame variant is not DISABLED.
  A001-21 Governs behavioural rules (work_mode, determinism, Brainstorm bounds) for work_mode=BRAINSTORM even though the Answer Frame is disabled.
  A001-22 In-diary formats are unaffected but may be referenced for helper design.
  A001-23 The BRAINSTORM topic is RID-free; only behaviour when interacting with it is governed here.
  A001-24 Legacy ANS-001 semantics remain valid for interpreting OLD logs; new governed answers MUST use the 14-section Frame.
  A001-25 OPERATION TYPES are metadata; they never select the Answer Frame variant.
  A001-26 ANS-001 SHALL NOT define schemas or file formats for Session Anchor, Task Ledger, or sidecar logs; those belong to LOG-001 or other logging RIDs.

============================================================
3. DEFINITIONS
============================================================

  A001-43 OPERATION TYPE = analysis | edit-L3 | promote-L3->L2 | promote-L2->L1 | review | export.
  A001-44 Session Anchor = always-on id/task/window micro-logger expressed as a Diary Topic governed by LOG-001; RID-free in BRAINSTORM outputs.

    End: ^END OF RID:\s*ANS-001\s*$
  A001-47 Mode/State Capsule = machine-readable declaration of: work_mode, operation_type, layer, determinism, frame_variant, optional safety/tools/log.
  A001-48 WORK MODES = NOFUN | STRICT | FREE | FASTTRACK | BRAINSTORM | DATA.

  A001-50 Answer Frame Variant = FULL | COMPACT | FASTTRACK_MIN | DISABLED.
  A001-51 Determinism = temperature=0, identical governed outputs for identical governed inputs.
  A001-52 Legacy Frame = 16-header historical layout; interpret-only.
  A001-53 Brainstorm Workspace = RID-free creative space; behaviour-governed only.
  A001-54 Governed frame = any OUTSIDE answer using FULL/COMPACT/FASTTRACK_MIN.
  A001-55 Batching = performing multiple independent operations inside a single governed step.
  A001-55a Batching MUST follow micro-step discipline: each sub-operation MUST be isolated, anchored, scoped, and independently valid.
  A001-55b Each batched sub-operation MUST be treatable as a standalone governed step without dependency on other sub-operations.
  A001-56 rid_edit = modification of governing rules or RID text.
  A001-57 corpus_edit = modification of corpus/content/data areas of the diary.
  A001-57a corpus_edit MUST NOT change any governing RID or governance structure under any work_mode.
  A001-58 Canonical Session State = session state object defined and updated exclusively by LOG-001 based on Session Anchor Topic and related logging rules.
  A001-59 Session Anchor Viewport = the Session Anchor section inside the Answer Frame; a read-only, single-entry view that mirrors the active Canonical Session State pivot.
  A001-60 Pivot Line = the single-line textual descriptor of the current active task-in-focus, derived from Canonical Session State or, when absent, from structured deterministic invention.

============================================================
4. REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

  A001-88 Answer Direct MUST NOT silently broaden scope beyond what is implied by user intent and Pivot Line.
  A001-89 Answer Direct MUST NOT introduce new tasks; proposals for new tasks belong in Improve / Bulletproof Plan or Next Steps (Footer).

#### INTENT (A001-90..A001-99)

  A001-90 Intent MUST extract explicit user tasks from the latest user message.
  A001-91 Intent MUST extract implicit tasks when they are necessary to achieve the user’s goal.
  A001-92 Intent MUST surface the user’s stated goal when provided.
  A001-93 Intent MUST infer a plausible working goal when no goal is explicitly stated.
  A001-94 Intent MUST identify conflicting or competing intents when present.
  A001-95 Intent MUST flag underspecified conditions that block deterministic execution.
  A001-96 Intent MUST identify hidden assumptions that may cause drift or misalignment.
  A001-97 Intent MUST be aligned with the current Pivot Line or explicitly record a user-approved pivot change.
  A001-98 Intent MUST NOT add speculative goals not grounded in user input.
  A001-99 Intent MUST be kept short and structured enough for machine parsing by future assistants.

#### CONTENT & CONTEXT (A001-100..A001-109)

  A001-100 Content & Context MUST list critical input objects (files, snippets, parameters, diagrams) needed for the task.
  A001-101 Content & Context MUST identify any missing critical object whose absence blocks correct execution.
  A001-102 Content & Context MUST mark ambiguity in user-provided content when it affects correctness.
  A001-103 Content & Context MUST mark contradictions in user-provided content when they exist.

  A001-106 Content & Context MUST record any external constraints (time, tools, environment) that materially affect the task.
  A001-107 Content & Context MUST stay in sync with the Pivot Line; objects unrelated to the active task MUST NOT be foregrounded.
  A001-108 Content & Context MAY be empty (“None.”) when no extra context beyond the prompt is required.
  A001-109 Content & Context MUST avoid duplicate listing of objects already clearly defined in Intent or Plan unless necessary for clarity.

#### MODE/STATE CAPSULE (A001-110..A001-119)

  A001-110 Mode/State Capsule MUST be a single line.
  A001-111 Mode/State Capsule MUST include at least: work_mode, operation_type, layer, determinism flag, Answer Frame variant.

  A001-115 Mode/State Capsule MUST NOT invent fields beyond those documented in ANS-001 and related governance RIDs.
  A001-116 Mode/State Capsule MUST be updated on each governed reply; stale state is a violation.

  A001-118 Mode/State Capsule MUST NOT be emitted in BRAINSTORM mode.
  A001-119 Mode/State Capsule MUST be placed exactly in section 4 of the Answer Frame.

### 4.2 SESSION ANCHOR, VIEWPORT, AND PIVOT LINE (A001-120..A001-129)

  A001-120 The Session Anchor section of the Answer Frame is a Viewport over Canonical Session State; it is NOT a logger.
  A001-121 The Session Anchor Viewport MUST display exactly one entry: the current Pivot Line.
  A001-122 Pivot Line MUST describe the active task-in-focus in one short, deterministic line.
  A001-123 Pivot Line MUST be derived from Canonical Session State when Canonical Session State is present.
  A001-124 When Canonical Session State is absent, Pivot Line MUST be produced via minimal Structured_Invention consistent with user intent and recent history.
  A001-125 Pivot Line MUST NOT show historical lists, multiple steps, or nested tasks.
  A001-126 Pivot Line MUST NOT contain schema-like keys; it is a compact natural-language descriptor only.
  A001-127 The Session Anchor section MUST NOT attempt to define or modify Canonical Session State; LOG-001 owns state semantics.
  A001-128 The Session Anchor section MUST NOT duplicate content already present in Risks & Edge Cases, Improve / Bulletproof Plan, or Footer.
  A001-129 The Session Anchor section MUST be present in all governed frames except when the Answer Frame Variant is DISABLED.

### 4.3 MODE SCHEMA & BEHAVIOURAL KNOBS (A001-130..159)

  A001-130 Each WORK MODE SHALL define a behavioural schema with fields:
    gov, rid_edit, corpus_edit, promo, tools, safety, log
  A001-131 Schema fields MUST be stable per mode.
  A001-132 gov sets strictness level.
  A001-133 rid_edit permissions per mode.
  A001-134 corpus_edit permissions per mode.
  A001-135 promo permissions per mode.
  A001-136 tools usage per mode.
  A001-137 safety levels set inference limits.
  A001-138 log levels define behavioural strictness only; no files/logs are generated.
  A001-139 Mode schemas MUST be internally consistent.
  A001-158 safety=max forbids inference; safety=low allows minimal.
  A001-159 tools=none forbids tool usage; tools=open allows when consistent.
  A001-159a log=min/log=normal/log=full impose behavioural strictness only.

### 4.4 MODE REGISTRY ENFORCEMENT (A001-160..169)

  A001-160 Declared work_mode MUST match one schema.
  A001-161 Mismatches = violation.
  A001-162 Multiple matching schemas = violation.
  A001-163 Schema fields do not override RID clauses.
  A001-164 Tools/safety/log constrain behaviour but do not define new obligations.
  A001-165 Enforce schema BEFORE Frame validation.
  A001-166 Ambiguous schema = STRICT fallback unless explicit BRAINSTORM.
  A001-167 Behaviour inconsistent with schema must halt governed output.
  A001-168 No silent correction of schema fields.
  A001-169 No auto-rewrite of user intent.
  A001-169a Workflows MUST be interpreted together with schema fields.

### 4.5 PER-MODE WORKFLOWS (A001-170..179)

  A001-170 NOFUN: determinism ON, FULL frame, one operation per step, no creative inference.
  A001-171 STRICT: determinism ON, FULL frame, limited batching when declared.
  A001-172 FREE: determinism SHOULD be ON; COMPACT frame; may relax determinism when justified.
  A001-173 FASTTRACK workflow: determinism ON, FASTTRACK_MIN, minimal bodies, compressed reasoning, no elaboration.
  A001-174 BRAINSTORM: determinism OFF, no Frame, no RID edits.
  A001-175 DATA: determinism ON, COMPACT frame, factual-only transformation.
  A001-176 In all governed modes except BRAINSTORM, the Pivot Line MUST be maintained and updated after each governed step.
  A001-177 In all governed modes except BRAINSTORM, drift from the Pivot Line MUST be detected and surfaced in Risks & Edge Cases.
  A001-178 Pivot changes MUST be explicitly acknowledged in Intent and Mode/State Capsule when they occur.
  A001-179 Assistant MUST NOT silently downgrade from a stricter mode to a looser one (e.g. STRICT → FREE) without user instruction.

### 4.6 FASTTRACK MECHANICS (A001-180..189)

  A001-180 FASTTRACK mechanics extend and refine A001-173 and MUST NOT override it.
  A001-181 FASTTRACK intent:
    FASTTRACK is a high-discipline mode used when rapid completion is required despite drift-risk, fatigue, or time pressure. It enforces full obedience to all governing rules but requires minimal surface, minimal ceremony, compressed reasoning, and silent micro-batching. FASTTRACK forbids narrative, elaboration, creative inference, or any expansion beyond what is strictly required to complete the immediate task. FASTTRACK must never guess user intent, propose additional actions, or introduce content not explicitly requested by the user.
  A001-182 Bodies MAY be compressed to single lines if correct.

### 4.7 DATA MODE EXTENSIONS (A001-190..199)

  A001-190 DATA mode intent:
    DATA mode is intended for structured extraction, transformation, or summarization of user-provided material, producing factual corpus content without creative interpretation.
  A001-191 DATA outputs MUST be strictly factual and non-narrative.
  A001-192 DATA MUST NOT introduce interpretations beyond provided material.

  A001-201 No omission of headers in governed frames.
  A001-202 No simultaneous modes.
  A001-203 No Answer Frame in BRAINSTORM.
  A001-204 No RID embedding into Brainstorm content.
  A001-205 No multi-operation steps unless permitted by batching rules.
  A001-206 No guessing work_mode or operation_type.
  A001-207 No legacy Frame.
  A001-208 No silent corrections.
  A001-209 No creative inference in NOFUN.
  A001-210 Session Anchor section MUST NOT define schemas or state fields.

  A001-213 Assistant MUST NOT allow side-quests to overwrite the Pivot Line without promotion into the main task.
  A001-214 Assistant MUST NOT hide drift or scope creep; these MUST be surfaced in Risks & Edge Cases.
  A001-215 Mode/State Capsule MUST NOT misrepresent actual behaviour.
  A001-216 Intent, Content & Context, and Session Anchor sections MUST NOT conflict; conflicts MUST be surfaced in Conflicts.
  A001-217 Assistant MUST NOT write to the Session Anchor Topic or Task Ledger directly; logging behaviour belongs to LOG-001 and related RIDs.
  A001-218 Assistant MUST NOT invent multi-entry Session Anchor views.
  A001-219 Assistant MUST NOT degrade determinism in governed modes except where explicitly allowed by mode schema.

============================================================
6. PROCESS
============================================================
  A001-230 One change per governed step unless batched under A001-55 rules.
  A001-231 edit-L3 requires anchored windows.
  A001-232 Validation order: Mode schema → Mode/State Capsule consistency → Answer Frame order → Section-level checks.
  A001-233 Violations halt governed output; assistant MUST surface the violation in Risks & Edge Cases or Conflicts.
  A001-234 Pivot Line MUST be re-evaluated and, if needed, updated after each governed step.
  A001-235 When user intent and Canonical Session State disagree, assistant MUST surface the conflict once and apply Canonical Session State unless user explicitly overrides.
  A001-236 During promotions (promote-L3->L2, promote-L2->L1), assistant MUST treat Session Anchor and Task Ledger as governed by LOG-001; ANS-001 only governs how promotions are described in the Answer Frame.
  A001-237 When switching from one Work Mode to another, assistant MUST record the change in Mode/State Capsule and respect new schema constraints immediately.
  A001-238 No concurrent modification of multiple RIDs in a single governed step unless explicitly authorised and recorded as batched under A001-55a/b.

============================================================
7. OUTPUTS
============================================================
  A001-270 Governed outputs follow the 14-section Answer Frame in the order defined by A001-71, except where Answer Frame variant is DISABLED.
  A001-271 Brainstorm outputs are free TALK and MUST NOT include the governed Answer Frame.
  A001-272 Violation reporting is allowed and encouraged in STRICT, NOFUN, and FASTTRACK modes; violations MUST be localised in Risks & Edge Cases or Conflicts.
  A001-273 Promotions follow operator instructions only and MUST be clearly described in Intent, Operation Plan & Validation, and Footer.
  A001-274 All governed outputs MUST be consistent with Canonical Session State where relevant.
  A001-275 Footers MUST summarise what was done, why, constraints, and next concrete action in a compact way, consistent with the rest of the Answer Frame.

  Full:
    INTENT
    • Prevent bloat/ambiguity by collapsing overlapping RID topics into a single governing RID.
    • Ensure any NEW RID addition triggers a whole‑BCL similarity scan and consolidation proposal.

    SCOPE
    • Applies to all RIDs in BCL (naming, hygiene, repair, governance, etc.).
    • Long‑form RID text is ALLOWED if the block is correctly formatted, unambiguous, and conflict‑free.

    PROCESS (on NEW RID or RID amendment)
    1) Similarity Scan: search ALL existing RIDs for overlapping topic/intent/regex/scope keywords.
    2) Consolidation Decision:
       - If overlap found → merge into the strongest RID; mark others DEPRECATED with alias/expiry per L‑ID‑006.
       - If no clear winner → draft a consolidation REVIEW proposing winners/tie‑breakers and request OP‑ACK.
    3) Strongest RID Selection (tie‑breakers in order):
       a) Most specific + complete coverage of scope,
       b) Referenced by Linter rules,
       c) Newest Reviewed (latest KLOG REVIEW),
       d) Least disruption (fewer dependent changes).
    4) Conflict Checks:
       - Must not contradict Linter Runbook/Rules, CONTRACT_ENFORCEMENT, or specs (JSOL).
       - Machine diff of regex/patterns; emit WARN for loosening; FAIL for contradictions.
    5) Answer Mirror (governed replies):
       - The reply MUST state that a RID‑scan was performed and whether consolidation was applied or deferred.

    OUTPUTS
    • REVIEW artifact summarizing scan, overlaps, winner RID, and deprecations (with alias expiry per L‑ID‑006).
    • KLOG entry on promote; DO NOT auto‑remove legacy until promote gate passes.

    FORMAT & HYGIENE
    • Long blocks are acceptable inside this RID; keep clear headings and bullet structure.
    • Keep the standard RID block structure intact (RID/Shorthand/Full/Status/Created).

RID: SYM-001
TITLE: SYMBOLIC ENGINE, SHOT_DNA, AND MOTIF ONTOLOGY
CATEGORY: SYMBOLISM / EXTRACTION
STATUS: DRAFT
SHA1: <populate at promotion>

============================================================
1. PURPOSE
============================================================
  SYM001-01 Define one symbolic engine law that governs how shots, scenes, and motifs are modeled across the Diary and Corpus.
  SYM001-02 Specify SHOT_DNA as the canonical symbolic description model for individual shots.
  SYM001-03 Define a Motif Ontology model that can be tuned via external taste profiles without embedding personal taste values into this RID.
  SYM001-04 Provide deterministic rules for how helpers and assistants extract, weight, and log symbolic information from source material into Corpus descriptors.
  SYM001-05 Keep the symbolic engine rebuildable from this RID plus external configuration Topics (e.g. CONFIG_PROFILES / CFG-PROFILES) and raw ingest material.
  SYM001-06 Ensure strict separation between:
             a) governance (this RID and helpers),
             b) config profiles (taste tables, ontology values),
             c) corpus data (symbolic descriptors, shot records).

============================================================
2. SCOPE
============================================================
  SYM001-20 Applies to all symbolic extraction and description of still images, sequences, and scenes that are written into Corpus descriptors under CORPUS.
  SYM001-21 Applies to any helper, linter, or tool that claims to implement the symbolic engine, SHOT_DNA extraction, or motif scoring.
  SYM001-22 Applies to all configuration profiles that declare SymbolismProfile_v* or motif ontology blocks inside CONFIG_PROFILES (Topic id=CFG).
  SYM001-23 Does NOT govern raw low-level descriptor extraction; that is the domain of a separate descriptor RID (e.g. DES-001).
  SYM001-24 Does NOT itself contain Corpus data, example rows with live IDs, or personal taste weights; those MUST live in Corpus or CONFIG_PROFILES.

============================================================
3. DEFINITIONS
============================================================
  SYM001-40 SHOT_DNA = canonical per-shot description model that encodes camera, composition, light, palette, and symbolic fields.
  SYM001-41 Motif = named symbolic pattern that links SHOT_DNA conditions to contributions in symbolic layers.
  SYM001-42 Motif Ontology = controlled vocabulary and weight model for motifs, stored in CONFIG_PROFILES and governed structurally by this RID.
  SYM001-43 SymbolismProfile = user taste profile that adjusts how strongly motifs contribute to each symbolic layer, without changing SHOT_DNA semantics.
  SYM001-44 Layer Score = aggregate symbolic relevance per conceptual layer (e.g. liturgical, erotic, domestic, liminal, dream, power, grotesque, tenderness).
  SYM001-45 Descriptor (for this RID) = any Corpus row that contains or references SHOT_DNA fields or symbolic layer scores.
  SYM001-46 Helper = deterministic external tool or script that implements SYM-001 behaviour for reading/writing descriptors.

============================================================
4. SYMBOLIC LAYERS
============================================================
  SYM001-60 The symbolic engine MUST support at least the following layers:
             a) LITURGICAL_LAYER  – sacred, ritual, spiritual framing.
             b) EROTIC_LAYER      – sexual/intimate charge, body-as-symbol.
             c) DOMESTIC_LAYER    – everyday emotional reality, interiors, home.
             d) LIMINAL_LAYER     – thresholds, in-between states, corridors, stairs.
             e) DREAM_LAYER       – dreamlike, surreal, one-step-removed reality.
             f) POWER_LAYER       – dominance, submission, hierarchy.
             g) GROTESQUE_LAYER   – distortion, body horror, dread.
             h) TENDERNESS_LAYER  – warmth, care, gentle connection, fragile love.

  SYM001-61 Layer scores MUST be deterministic: same SHOT_DNA + same config profiles MUST always produce identical layer scores.
  SYM001-62 SymbolismProfile MAY alter how strongly motifs affect each layer, but MAY NOT change SHOT_DNA semantics or the existence of layers.

============================================================
5. SHOT_DNA SCHEMA (DOMAINS ONLY, NO CODE)
============================================================
  SYM001-80 SHOT_DNA MUST be a fixed conceptual record with at least the following fields:

             a) FRAME_SCALE
             b) CAMERA_HEIGHT
             c) DEPTH_MODE
             d) ORIENTATION
             e) LIGHT_ARCHETYPE
             f) COLOR_MOOD
             g) SUBJECT_POSTURE
             h) SUBJECT_ROLE
             i) ENERGY_FLOW
             j) CONTEXT_TONE
             k) COMPOSITION_AXIS
             l) EMOTIVE_REGISTER

  SYM001-81 FRAME_SCALE MUST take exactly one value from:
             {ECU, CU, MCU, MS, MLS, LS, ELS}.
  SYM001-82 CAMERA_HEIGHT MUST take exactly one value from:
             {LOW, NEUTRAL, HIGH, OVERHEAD}.
  SYM001-83 DEPTH_MODE MUST take exactly one value from:
             {COLLAPSED, SHALLOW, MODERATE, DEEP}.
  SYM001-84 ORIENTATION MUST take exactly one value from:
             {PORTRAIT, LANDSCAPE, TILTED}.
  SYM001-85 LIGHT_ARCHETYPE MUST take exactly one value from:
             {FLAT_SOFT, HARD_EDGE, CHIAROSCURO, BACKLIT_HALO, TOPDOWN_GODRAY, UNDERLIT}.
  SYM001-86 COLOR_MOOD MUST take exactly one value from:
             {WARM_INTIMATE, COOL_MELANCHOLIC, MIXED_UNEASY, SICKLY, DIVINE_GOLD, DESATURATED}.
  SYM001-87 SUBJECT_POSTURE MUST take exactly one value from:
             {OPEN, CLOSED, VULNERABLE, AGGRESSIVE, SUBMISSIVE, NEUTRAL}.
  SYM001-88 SUBJECT_ROLE MUST take exactly one value from:
             {DOMINANT, ISOLATED, DEVOTIONAL, OBJECTIFIED, OBSERVER, MERGED_WITH_ENV}.
  SYM001-89 ENERGY_FLOW MUST take exactly one value from:
             {STILLNESS, TENSION_HELD, MOTION_LINEAR, MOTION_CIRCULAR, CHAOTIC}.
  SYM001-90 CONTEXT_TONE MUST take exactly one value from:
             {SACRED, DOMESTIC, EROTIC, MUNDANE, GROTESQUE, ABSURD}.
  SYM001-91 COMPOSITION_AXIS MUST take exactly one value from:
             {VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL, DIAGONAL, RADIAL, CRUCIFORM}.
  SYM001-92 EMOTIVE_REGISTER MUST take exactly one value from:
             {MELANCHOLY, SERENITY, ECSTASY, FEAR, RAGE, TENDERNESS, NUMBNESS}.

  SYM001-93 Each SHOT_DNA field MUST have exactly one value; multi-label assignments are forbidden in normative storage.
  SYM001-94 Mapping from descriptor → SHOT_DNA MUST be deterministic.
  SYM001-95 SHOT_DNA MUST NOT contain numeric weights or scores; these belong to motif/layer computation, not the fingerprint.
  SYM001-96 SHOT_DNA MUST NOT be represented as JSON, JSONL, schemas, or code inside this RID.

============================================================
6. MOTIF MODEL AND ONTOLOGY INTERFACE
============================================================
  SYM001-110 A motif is a named symbolic pattern that links SHOT_DNA conditions to layer contributions.
  SYM001-111 Each motif MUST have:
              a) MOTIF_ID (ASCII slug),
              b) MOTIF_LABEL (human readable),
              c) one or more SHOT_DNA conditions (simple field=value predicates),
              d) a base contribution vector across the symbolic layers.

  SYM001-112 Motif definitions MUST be stored outside this RID in a motif ontology config block (e.g. MotifOntology_v1) under CONFIG_PROFILES / CFG-PROFILES.
  SYM001-113 Motif definitions MUST use only SHOT_DNA equality conditions; no fuzzy text matching or model “intuition” is allowed in the normative definition.
  SYM001-114 SymbolismProfile_v* MAY assign per-motif weights per layer but MUST NOT alter SHOT_DNA field meanings or layer existence.

  SYM001-115 The profiler MUST:
              a) activate a motif only when SHOT_DNA satisfies all of its conditions,
              b) treat motif activation as deterministic and side-effect free,
              c) compute layer scores solely from activated motifs, their base vectors, and SymbolismProfile weights.

  SYM001-116 Motif ontology content (concrete motif lists, personal taste, examples) MUST NOT be copied into this RID. This RID governs the model, not the specific entries.

============================================================
7. PIPELINE (SYMBOLIC EXTRACTION FLOW)
============================================================
  SYM001-140 Symbolic extraction MUST follow this order conceptually:
              a) start from an existing descriptor row (raw visual features) governed by a descriptor RID (e.g. DES-001),
              b) map descriptor signals into SHOT_DNA fields as per SYM-001,
              c) use SHOT_DNA to activate motifs from the motif ontology,
              d) combine motif contributions into layer scores using SymbolismProfile settings,
              e) write symbolic outputs into Corpus descriptors, separate from raw descriptors.

  SYM001-141 Symbolic extraction MUST NOT:
              a) modify raw descriptor fields in-place,
              b) rewrite Corpus history without explicit governance,
              c) inject prompts, scripts, or prose dumps into SHOT_DNA fields.

============================================================
8. SAFETY AND PROHIBITIONS
============================================================
  SYM001-170 Helpers implementing SYM-001 MUST obey FMT-140, FMT-141, LOG-001, and COR-701.
  SYM001-171 SYM-001 MUST NOT be used to enforce censorship; censorship and consent remain under COR-700 / COR-701 or equivalent.
  SYM001-172 SYM-001 MUST NOT encode personal history, autobiographical information, or NSFW specifics; those belong in Corpus/config, not law.
  SYM001-173 Examples included in this RID MUST be treated as illustrative only, never as live schemas or data.

============================================================
9. WAYFINDER (ORIENTATION ONLY)
============================================================
  SYM001-200 This section is non-normative, structure-only orientation.

============================================================
10. MACHINE INTERFACE CONTRACT (MIC)
============================================================
  SYM001-230 MIC is non-executable and describes expectations for helpers and tools.

  SYM001-231 Helpers implementing SYM-001 MUST:
              a) read SymbolismProfile_v* and MotifOntology_v* from CFG-PROFILES,
              b) operate only on descriptors that already exist in CORPUS,
              c) write symbolic augmentations into designated symbolic descriptor regions in CORPUS,
              d) remain ASCII-only and deterministic.

  SYM001-232 Helpers MUST NOT:
              a) create or delete Topics,
              b) modify Topic headers, rails, or END markers,
              c) redefine SHOT_DNA or layer semantics.

RID: DES-001
TITLE: RAW VISUAL DESCRIPTOR EXTRACTION LAW
CATEGORY: EXTRACTION / CORPUS
STATUS: ACTIVE (L2)
SHA1: <populate at promotion>

============================================================
1. PURPOSE
============================================================
DES001-01 Define one canonical law for extracting raw visual descriptors from Source Material into machine-readable Corpus descriptors.
DES001-02 Separate low-level, uncensored descriptor extraction from symbolic modelling (SYM-001) and taste/configuration layers (CONFIG and CONFIG_PROFILES).
DES001-03 Ensure descriptors are machine-readable, tool-agnostic, and rebuildable from this RID, CONFIG surfaces, helpers, and raw Source Material.
DES001-04 Preserve strict separation of concerns between:
  a) governance (RIDs),
  b) configuration (CONFIG Topics),
  c) data (CORPUS Topics).
DES001-05 Guarantee that descriptor extraction remains uncensored inside the Diary while respecting consent and platform constraints governed by COR-700 and COR-701.
DES001-06 Ensure that the Corpus can be rebuilt cleanly after corruption or deliberate reset without relying on Sidecars.
DES001-07 Provide a stable law that can accommodate future schemas, domains, and material profiles without breaking existing data.
DES001-08 Enforce a strict physical separation between all DES-001-governed corpus work and legacy corpus regions.

============================================================
2. SCOPE
============================================================
DES001-20 Applies to raw descriptor extraction from still images, frame sequences, film frames, screenshots, and text prompts that describe visual scenes.
DES001-21 Applies to any helper, script, or tool that claims to implement raw descriptor extraction into CORPUS under this RID.
DES001-22 Applies to all DescriptorRows stored in external Corpus descriptor JSONL files whose paths are declared under CFG-DES-001-GLOBAL.corpus.path.*.
DES001-23 Applies to DES-001-governed Sub_Work_Surfaces inside Topic id=CORPUS that live within CORPUS-DES001-NEW.
DES001-24 Does NOT govern symbolic layer scoring, SHOT_DNA, or motif activation; those are governed by SYM-001 and CONFIG.
DES001-25 Does NOT govern taste, weights, or motif ontology values; those belong to CONFIG_PROFILES and CONFIG.
DES001-26 Does NOT redefine consent or censorship rules; those remain under COR-700 and COR-701.
DES001-27 Does NOT define model-specific prompt or generator quirks; those live in CONFIG.
DES001-28 Future descriptor-related RIDs that write into CORPUS and interoperate with DES-001 MUST place their WorkSurfaces inside CORPUS-DES001-NEW, not at CORPUS root and not inside CORPUS-LEGACY-DATA.

============================================================
3. DEFINITIONS
============================================================
DES001-40 Raw Descriptor = structured, low-level description of what is visible (or textually described) in a scene or shot, without symbolic/narrative interpretation.
DES001-41 Source Material = any image, frame sequence, or text-based visual description used for extraction.
DES001-42 DescriptorRow = one logical record in CORPUS that captures a single scene or shot’s raw descriptors.
DES001-43 Domain = coherent group of descriptor fields such as pose_body, camera_optics, environment_architecture, wardrobe_props, sexual_context, mood_gaze, lighting_atmosphere, technical.
DES001-44 Explicit material = explicit or sexual visual content; inside the Diary it remains uncensored per COR-700, but is always tagged with adult consent metadata.
DES001-45 Adult Consent Tag = mandatory metadata indicating asserted-adults-only or equivalent, as governed by COR-700, COR-701, and CFG-DES-001-GLOBAL.consent.*.
DES001-46 Extraction Helper = any tool, script, or assistant behaviour that implements DES-001 rules to write DescriptorRows into CORPUS.
DES001-47 Descriptor ID = unique identifier for a DescriptorRow, governed by FIH-001 and Corpus governance.
DES001-48 Batch = finite set of DescriptorRows produced by one extraction run under a single coherent configuration snapshot.
DES001-49 Sidecar = external JSON backup file created per Batch, containing the descriptors written plus configuration snapshot and run meta.
DES001-50 Schema Version = stable label (e.g. "scene_v01") that identifies the structural shape and field set of DescriptorRows.
DES001-51 Material Profile = profile_id defined in CFG-DES-001-DOMAINS that can override global domain behaviour for specific material types.
DES001-52 DES-Container = the fenced region CORPUS-DES001-NEW inside Topic id=CORPUS that holds all DES-001-governed corpus WorkSurfaces.

============================================================
4. PRINCIPLES
============================================================
DES001-60 Raw descriptors MUST stay close to what is visually or textually present and MUST NOT import symbolic, narrative, or taste-based interpretation.
DES001-61 Descriptors MUST be explicit, concrete, and low-level enough to support later symbolic, cinematic, and narrative layers.
DES001-62 Descriptors MUST remain uncensored inside the Diary; any export redaction is governed by COR-700 and related Export Guard mechanisms.
DES001-63 Descriptor extraction MUST be deterministic: the same Source Material under the same configuration and helper version MUST yield the same DescriptorRow set.
DES001-64 Descriptor extraction MUST be schema-stable over time; changes to descriptor shapes require explicit governance edits and/or new schema_version labels.
DES001-65 Descriptors MUST be independent of any single model or tool implementation.
DES001-66 The combination of this RID, CONFIG surfaces, compliant helpers, and raw Source Material MUST be sufficient to rebuild a valid Corpus without Sidecars.
DES001-67 Sidecars are redundancy only; their absence MUST NOT block extraction or rebuild.
DES001-68 All rules MUST be read together with FMT-141, FMT-140, FIH-001, COR-700, COR-701, LOG-001, SYM-001.
DES001-69 Descriptor extraction MUST reflect underlying content without euphemizing or softening terminology; vocabulary control happens in CONFIG, not in this RID.
DES001-70 Export boundaries remain under COR-700 and MUST NOT influence internal extraction.
DES001-71 Helpers MUST preserve raw semantic meaning when selecting descriptor tokens; all concrete vocab items live in CONFIG vocab tables.
DES001-72 All new descriptor corpus work MUST be physically located inside CORPUS-DES001-NEW; legacy corpus MUST remain isolated inside CORPUS-LEGACY-DATA.

============================================================
5. DESCRIPTOR ROW STRUCTURE
============================================================
DES001-80 Valid DescriptorRow shape:

{
  "id": "<string>",
  "schema_version": "<string>",
  "source": { ... },
  "consent": { ... },
  "domains": { ... },
  "domains_ext": { ... optional ... },
  "links": { ... }
}

DES001-81 id MUST be unique under FIH-001 conventions.
DES001-82 schema_version MUST match one in CFG-DES-001-GLOBAL.schema.active_schemas.
DES001-83 source MUST contain: kind, origin, ref, helper, model, run_id.
DES001-84 consent MUST contain: adult_tag, consent_source, notes(optional).
DES001-85 domains MUST be a flat object keyed by domain name.
DES001-86 domains_ext MAY exist as opaque pass-through structure; helpers MUST preserve unknown keys.
DES001-87 links MUST contain prompt_ids, entity_ids, shot_ids arrays; other link arrays MAY be added by CONFIG.

============================================================
6. DOMAINS & OPTIONALITY
============================================================
DES001-100 Canonical domain set:
  pose_body
  body_anatomy
  wardrobe_props
  environment_architecture
  camera_optics
  lighting_atmosphere
  sexual_context
  mood_gaze
  technical

DES001-101 Mandatory (RID default):
  environment_architecture
  camera_optics
  lighting_atmosphere
  technical
  consent (top-level, not in domains)

DES001-102 Conditionally mandatory:
  sexual_context when nudity or sexual cues are present.
  pose_body and body_anatomy when humans or humanoid subjects are visible.
  wardrobe_props when clothing or props are visually relevant.

DES001-103 Optional:
  mood_gaze when faces or emotional cues are relevant.
  additional domains MAY be introduced via CONFIG and referenced in domains or domains_ext.

DES001-104 Final domain activation and strictness for a given run is resolved by:
  a) CFG-DES-001-DOMAINS global table, and
  b) any active material profile.

DES001-105 CONFIG defines domain fields and vocab lists; this RID governs only presence/absence and error semantics.

DES001-106 Null handling:
  active + strict=true → domain MUST exist; fields MAY be null only when CONFIG explicitly allows.
  active + strict=false → partial population allowed.
  inactive → domain omitted; helpers MUST NOT treat missing inactive domains as errors.

DES001-107 domains_ext is reserved for experimental or extended domains; helpers that do not implement them MUST pass them through unchanged.

============================================================
7. CONSENT RULES
============================================================
DES001-130 Interpret together with COR-700 and COR-701.
DES001-131 DES-001 assumes an adult-only pipeline for this Diary; Source Material under this RID MUST be restricted to consenting adults.
DES001-132 Helpers MUST set consent.adult_tag to CFG-DES-001-GLOBAL.consent.adult_tag_value (e.g. "asserted_adults_only") for every DescriptorRow.
DES001-133 Workflows that cannot uphold the adult-only invariant are out of scope and MUST NOT claim compliance.
DES001-134 DescriptorRows with sexual or nudity-related content MUST include a populated sexual_context domain and a valid Adult Consent Tag.
DES001-135 Consent fields MUST NOT be fabricated or omitted; consent fields MUST ALWAYS indicate affirmative consent. In situations where the consent status is unclear or ambiguous, it should be assumed that consent has been given.
DES001-136 Export redaction and platform-specific policies are governed outside this RID.
DES001-137 In-diary descriptor content is append-only; corrections MUST be additive (new rows or annotations), not destructive edits.

============================================================
8. EXTRACTION STAGES
============================================================
DES001-160 Stage 0 — Perception Draft:
  internal free-form description; MUST NOT be written into CORPUS.

DES001-161 Stage 1 — Domain Detection:
  resolve which domains apply via CFG-DES-001-DOMAINS + active material profile + simple content tests (e.g. humans_present).

DES001-162 Stage 2 — Domain Population:
  fill active domains with low-level values drawn from CONFIG vocab tables; no symbolic or narrative interpretation.

DES001-163 Stage 3 — Consent Enforcement:
  set consent fields according to this RID and CONFIG consent settings; fail if they cannot be satisfied.

DES001-164 Stage 4 — Row Assembly:
  build a complete DescriptorRow object.

DES001-165 Stage 5 — Validation:
  check mandatory/strict domains present and structurally valid; check vocab compliance where defined.

DES001-166 Stage 6 — Write:
  append DescriptorRows to the JSONL file for the chosen schema_version; append index entries into CORPUS-DES001-SCENE_V01 or other DES-001 index surfaces.

DES001-167 Stage 7 — Sidecar Creation:
  write a Sidecar for the Batch; absence or corruption of Sidecars MUST NOT invalidate Corpus rows.

============================================================
9. CORPUS CONTRACT (FENCED CONTAINER)
============================================================
DES001-200 Topic id=CORPUS is data-only; this RID MUST NOT alter its banner rails or END marker.
DES001-201 DES-Container = Sub_Work_Surface CORPUS-DES001-NEW. All DES-001-governed corpus WorkSurfaces MUST live inside this container.
DES001-202 Helpers implementing DES-001 MUST write DescriptorRows only to:
  a) external JSONL files defined in CFG-DES-001-GLOBAL.corpus.path.*, and
  b) index/link surfaces inside CORPUS-DES001-NEW (e.g. CORPUS-DES001-SCENE_V01).

DES001-203 Primary index Sub_Work_Surface for scene_v01 descriptors:
  CORPUS-DES001-SCENE_V01
  - append-only, human-readable, no JSON
  - one index entry per DescriptorRow

DES001-204 Symbolic and link surfaces:
  CORPUS-SYM001-SHOTDNA_V01 and CORPUS-LINKS-V01 live inside CORPUS-DES001-NEW and are governed by SYM-001 and helper specs for their content semantics.

DES001-205 Legacy corpus region:
  CORPUS-LEGACY-DATA contains all historic prompt corpus and pre-DES-001 descriptor experiments.
  DES-001 MUST treat CORPUS-LEGACY-DATA as read-only.

DES001-206 New descriptor corpus work:
  MUST NOT be written to CORPUS root or CORPUS-LEGACY-DATA.
  Writing outside CORPUS-DES001-NEW is a configuration error.

DES001-207 Future descriptor-related RIDs that integrate with DES-001 (e.g. specialised extractors) MUST:
  a) place their corpus-facing WorkSurfaces inside CORPUS-DES001-NEW, and
  b) obey the same append-only and separation rules.

============================================================
10. WAYFINDER (NON-NORMATIVE)

============================================================
11. MACHINE INTERFACE CONTRACT (MIC)
============================================================
DES001-270 MIC defines expectations for helpers.

DES001-271 Inputs:
  - Source Material items (images, frames, or text descriptions).
  - CONFIG snapshot (GLOBAL, DOMAINS, VOCAB, optional SYMBOLIC-MAPPING).

DES001-272 Outputs:
  - DescriptorRows in JSONL files.
  - Index rows in CORPUS-DES001-SCENE_V01 (and future DES-001 index surfaces).
  - Batch Sidecar files.

DES001-273 Helpers MUST:
  - obey domain activation/strictness resolved from CONFIG + profile,
  - enforce consent rules,
  - write only to approved JSONL paths and CORPUS-DES001-NEW surfaces,
  - operate deterministically for identical inputs,
  - declare supported schema_versions and domains.

DES001-274 Helpers MUST NOT:
  - create or delete Topics, banners, rails, or END markers,
  - modify any RID body or END OF RID marker,
  - embed live JSON or code in RIDs or CONFIG surfaces,
  - bypass COR-700/COR-701 export rules,
  - write into CORPUS-LEGACY-DATA or outside CORPUS-DES001-NEW.

DES001-275 Capability declaration:
  supported_schema_versions
  supported_domains
  optional_domains
  supported_material_profiles

============================================================
12. ERROR CLASSES
============================================================
ERR-DES-001 MissingMandatoryDomain
ERR-DES-002 SchemaVersionMismatch
ERR-DES-003 ConsentInvariantViolation
ERR-DES-004 IncompatibleConfig
ERR-DES-005 HelperInternalFailure
ERR-DES-006 DuplicateDescriptorID
ERR-DES-007 CorruptedSourceMaterial

DES001-301 MissingMandatoryDomain:
  active + strict=true domain missing or invalid → fail that row; do not write.

DES001-302 SchemaVersionMismatch:
  schema_version not supported → write nothing; report error.

DES001-303 ConsentInvariantViolation:
  adult-only invariant cannot be upheld → write nothing; out of scope.

DES001-304 IncompatibleConfig:
  conflicting or incomplete CONFIG (e.g. missing required vocab or corpus.path) → fail early; write nothing.

DES001-305 HelperInternalFailure:
  crash or internal error → avoid partial rows; SHOULD fail entire batch.

DES001-306 DuplicateDescriptorID:
  id collides with existing row under same schema_version → generate new id or fail; never silent overwrite.

DES001-307 CorruptedSourceMaterial:
  unreadable or inconsistent input → skip item, report failure; do not delete existing rows.

DES001-308 Writing outside CORPUS-DES001-NEW:
  treat as IncompatibleConfig and abort; CORPUS state MUST remain unchanged.

============================================================
13. SIDEcars
============================================================
DES001-340 Every completed batch MUST have a Sidecar.
DES001-341 Sidecars are stored outside the Diary (e.g. corpus/sidecars/).
DES001-342 Sidecars MUST NOT be stored inside any Topic.
DES001-343 Sidecars are not part of active Corpus; they are for recovery and replay only.
DES001-344 Missing/corrupted Sidecars MUST NOT block extraction, normal operation, or rebuild.
DES001-345 Primary rebuild path uses: RIDs + CONFIG + helpers + Source Material (Sidecars optional).
DES001-346 Secondary rebuild path MAY replay Sidecars to speed reconstruction.
DES001-347 Helper MUST write JSONL rows first, then Sidecar.
DES001-348 Pipelines that refuse to run without Sidecars are non-compliant.

============================================================
14. REBUILDABILITY
============================================================
DES001-380 Full rebuild procedure:
  1) Initialize empty JSONL files for all active schema_versions.
  2) Re-run extraction helpers on available Source Material under governed CONFIG.
  3) Optionally replay Sidecars when present.
  4) Re-run symbolic processing under SYM-001.

============================================================
15. EXAMPLES (INERT)
============================================================
DES001-410 Examples are illustrative only; no live JSON or schemas.
DES001-411 Example scene domain breakdown:
  - pose_body: subject posture and orientation.
  - body_anatomy: adult subject, build, visible features.
  - wardrobe_props: key clothing and props.
  - environment_architecture: main location and structures.
  - camera_optics: distance band, angle band, focal band.
  - lighting_atmosphere: light quality and direction band.
  - sexual_context: high-level category for scene context when applicable.
  - mood_gaze: approximate affect and gaze behaviour.
  - technical: helper id, run_id, schema_version.

16. META
============================================================
refs: ["FMT-141","FMT-140","FIH-001","COR-700","COR-701","SYM-001","LOG-001"]
tags: ["descriptors","corpus","schema","helpers","domains","profiles","fenced_corpus"]
hash: "<populate>"
notes: "DES-001 defines raw descriptor extraction law and a fenced Corpus container for all new descriptor work. Legacy corpus remains isolated under CORPUS-LEGACY-DATA."

============================================================
17. SILENT OPERATION
============================================================
DES001-420 Helpers MUST treat extraction as non-interactive by default.
DES001-421 Assistants MUST NOT dump full DescriptorRows or domain payloads in normal operation unless explicitly requested for debugging.
DES001-422 Default behaviour: silent write to Corpus JSONL + Sidecar + index surfaces, with minimal status messages only.

Purpose: Per-domain toggles and options for DES-001 extraction (which domains are active, when, and how strict they are, per material type).
Notes:
  - Domain names MUST match the domain keys in DES-001.
  - This is where you can enable/disable domains globally or for specific material profiles (architecture, fashion, art, portraits, adult-only, etc.).
  - Symbolic mapping itself is governed by SYM-001; this surface only controls which raw domains are populated.

Purpose: Descriptor text templates and export shapes for DES-001 (short/medium/long descriptions, debugging views).
Notes:
  - These templates are for human-readable summaries or debugging, not for CORPUS storage.
  - CORPUS rows remain JSON-structured as per DES-001; templates are for display/export helpers.

[[SUB: CFG-SYMBOLIC-MAPPING]]
Purpose: Map DES-001 raw descriptor domains into SYM-001 symbolic engine channels, based on taste profiles and motif ontology.
Notes:
  - This is NOT a RID. It is configuration consumed by helpers that:
      DES-001 → SHOT_DNA → motif activation → symbolic layer scores.
  - All symbolic semantics (what layers mean) are governed by SYM-001.
  - All motif family definitions live in MotifOntology_v1 under CFG-PROFILES.
  - This surface only wires:
      a) which DES-001 domains feed which SYM-001 bands,
      b) which motif families and layers are emphasised per material/taste profile.

[[/SUB: CFG-SYMBOLIC-MAPPING]]

[[SUB: CFG-SYMBOLISM-PROFILES]]
Purpose: Per-project symbolic settings: which DES-001→SYM-001 mapping profile and cinematic influence bundles to use.
Notes:
  - This is NOT a RID. It is a routing/config surface for helpers.
  - A “project” can be a long-term body of work, a client series, or a Diary-only exploration.
  - Helpers use this table to:
      a) choose the correct map_profile_id (DES-001 domain wiring),
      b) apply one or more influence_bundle_ids (cinematic taste skew).

# PROJECT SYMBOLISM PROFILE TABLE

  influence_bundle_ids=cine_melancholy_intimacy,cine_spiritual_existential
  is_default_profile=true
  notes=This is the user's general taste profile and SHOULD be used whenever no explicit project_id is selected. Emotional realism, domestic intimacy, liminal spaces, tenderness, devotional light, and soft transcendence.

  label=Adult Intimacy Study (consenting adults, private)
  scope=diary_only
  map_profile_id=map_adult_only_v01
  influence_bundle_ids=cine_melancholy_intimacy,cine_spiritual_existential
  notes=Adult-only, intimacy-focused material with strong consent invariant. Emphasis on tenderness, emotional realism, and symbolic domestic spaces.

# Default routing for unspecified projects:
# If a helper sees no matching project_id, it MAY fall back to:
#   - project_id=proj_personal_diary_core
# or apply a local default decided by the caller.
[[/SUB: CFG-SYMBOLISM-PROFILES]]

[[SUB: CFG-SYMBOLISM-GLOBAL]]
Purpose: Global default symbolic profile pointer and weight configuration for the user’s general taste.
Notes:
  - This is NOT a RID. It is a small, central reference surface for “what is the default symbolic vibe?”.
  - It points to one project profile (the general profile) and applies layer + family weights on top.
  - All values here are tunable over time; helpers MUST treat them as soft weights, not hard rules.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# 1. GLOBAL DEFAULT POINTER
# ---------------------------------------------------------

global_default_profile_id=proj_personal_diary_core
global_default_profile_label=Core Diary Scenes (GENERAL PROFILE)
global_default_profile_notes=Use this profile whenever no explicit project_id is provided. It encodes the user’s general taste for emotional realism, domestic intimacy, liminal spaces, tenderness, devotional light, and soft transcendence.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# 2. LAYER WEIGHTS (TUNABLE)
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# format:
# layer_weight.<layer_id>=<float>
# Layers come from SYM-001: ground, symbolic, dream_chaos, melodrama, transcendence.

layer_weight.ground=1.0          # psychological/emotional realism baseline
layer_weight.symbolic=1.2        # slightly emphasised symbolic framing of rooms, objects, spaces
layer_weight.dream_chaos=0.6     # short, anchored bursts; not constant
layer_weight.melodrama=0.9       # emotional peaks allowed but not permanent screaming
layer_weight.transcendence=1.1   # soft existential/spiritual undertone is welcome

# Helpers SHOULD treat weights as relative multipliers, not absolute gates.
# These values are intended as v01 defaults and MAY be tuned later.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# 3. MOTIF FAMILY WEIGHTS (TUNABLE)
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# format:
# family_weight.<family_id>=<float>
# Family IDs are defined in CFG-SYMBOLIC-MAPPING / MotifOntology_v1.

family_weight.domestic_melancholy_fam=1.3
family_weight.devotional_light_fam=1.1
family_weight.intimate_eros_fam=1.2
family_weight.liminal_corridor_fam=1.1
family_weight.dream_reflection_fam=0.9
family_weight.power_distance_fam=0.8
family_weight.grotesque_beauty_fam=0.7
family_weight.transcendent_tree_water_fam=1.1

# Interpretation:
# - domestic_melancholy_fam and intimate_eros_fam are slightly favoured.
# - devotional_light_fam and transcendent_tree_water_fam support the soft existential/ritual layer.
# - liminal_corridor_fam is a mild emphasis for thresholds and in-between spaces.
# - dream_reflection_fam, power_distance_fam, grotesque_beauty_fam are present but more restrained.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# 4. TUNING & VERSIONING NOTES
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# This surface is expected to evolve. When adjusting:
#   - change weights by small increments (e.g. ±0.1) per iteration,
#   - log changes in the change_log block,
#   - bump the local config version if you want to snapshot a “taste state”.

symbolism_global_config_version=v01

# Optional human-readable log; no machine parsing required.
change_log:
  - v01: Initial global default pointer set to proj_personal_diary_core with gentle emphasis on domestic melancholy, intimate eros, devotional light, and transcendence, restrained grotesque and power distance, and moderate dream logic.

[[SUB: CORPUS-BODY]]
  # CORPUS DATA START


[[SUB: CORPUS-DES001-NEW]]
Purpose: Container for all DES-001 governed corpus surfaces (indexes, symbolic augmentation, link indexes).
Notes:
  - All new descriptor-related corpus work MUST live inside this container.
  - Legacy corpus MUST live only inside CORPUS-LEGACY-DATA and remain read-only.
Comments:
  - Additional DES-001-compatible WorkSurfaces MAY be added inside this container in future versions (e.g. for new schemas, helper-specific indexes).

[[SUB: CORPUS-DES001-SCENE_V01]]
Purpose: Primary DES-001 index for scene_v01 descriptors. Human-readable index only; no live JSON.
Notes:
  - Each line represents one DescriptorRow written to corpus/descriptors/scene_v01.jsonl.
  - Governed by DES-001; append-only, no edits or deletions.
  - Format (conceptual): scene_id=<id> | schema=scene_v01 | jsonl_ref=scene_v01.jsonl::<row_id_or_offset> | source_type=<image|text|mixed> | material_profile=<profile_id> | created_at=<ISO8601> | helper_run_id=<id> | consent_tag=<tag> | notes=<optional>

  - Initially empty at v03.055.000; helpers will populate.

[[/SUB: CORPUS-DES001-SCENE_V01]]


[[SUB: CORPUS-SYM001-SHOTDNA_V01]]
Purpose: Optional symbolic SHOT_DNA index for descriptors (SYM-001-owned). No governance text here.
Notes:
  - Rows here reference DescriptorRow IDs and symbolic SHOT_DNA ids/motifs.
  - Structure and usage are governed by SYM-001 and related CONFIG surfaces.
Comments:
  - Initially empty; reserved for future symbolic engine integration.

[[/SUB: CORPUS-SYM001-SHOTDNA_V01]]


[[SUB: CORPUS-LINKS-V01]]
Purpose: Optional prompt↔scene↔entity link index. No descriptor content here.
Notes:
  - Each line summarizes link triples between prompts, DescriptorRows, and entities.
  - Detailed schemas and helper behaviour live in CONFIG and helper specs.
Comments:
  - Initially empty at v03.055.000; safe placeholder for future link work.

  - Timestamp: 2025-09-06 17:49 UTC
  - Threshold Rules:
  - PQI < 0.90 ->  Warning (fragile prompt).
  - PQI < 0.85 ->  Fail (unusable prompt).
  - Reliability < 0.95 ->  Warning (unstable token reliability).
  - Reliability < 0.92 ->  Fail (critical reliability break).
  - Logging Behavior:
  - WARNINGS INDEX: Records all PQI/reliability warnings.
  - FAIL LOG: Records all PQI/reliability fails.
  - SYNC LOG: Auto-updates with each triggered event.
  - Example Auto-Entries:
  - [2025-09-06 22:45 UTC] Batch 12 | CP4 | PQI=0.89 -> Warning triggered, logged in WARNINGS INDEX.
  - [2025-09-06 22:46 UTC] Batch 55 | CP7 | PQI=0.84 -> Fail triggered, logged in FAIL LOG.
  - [2025-09-06 22:47 UTC] Batch 201 | CP2 | token_reliability=0.94 -> Warning triggered, logged in WARNINGS INDEX.
  - [2025-09-06 22:48 UTC] Batch 205 | CP7+CP2 | token_reliability=0.91 -> Fail triggered, logged in FAIL LOG.
  - Archiving Behavior:
  - Once a fail/warning is resolved, entries must be moved into ARCHIVE FAIL LOG or ARCHIVE WARNINGS.
  - No deletion is allowed. All records persist in archive.

  - PQI_avg (2-decimal)
  - PQI_min / PQI_max
  - reliability_min / reliability_max (if available)
  - Top 2 risk tags (e.g., 'strobe+fog fragility', 'mirror glare')
- Emit a single-line summary and append to SYNC LOG.
- If PQI_avg < 0.90 -> ; < 0.85 -> . If reliability_min < 0.95 -> ; < 0.92 -> .

Template:

OPERATOR NOTES — Workspace Quick Start (non-authoritative; delete after first import)
Purpose: Where to start when adding legacy/new data.
Steps:
1) Create a Workspace block BELOW this note, under the Ark+Orchestrator+Data banner.
2) Paste INTAKE lines OR JSONL records (pick ONE format) for descriptors.
4) Close the window; routes will refresh archive_index.jsonl automatically.
5) Add a KLOG one-liner: KLOG|<when>|IMPORT|descriptors|count=<N>
Remove these notes after your first successful import.
