# TASK_PACKET_STUB_TEMPLATE

This is a BACKLOG STUB. It is NOT an executable Task Packet.

Rules:
- No USER_SIGNATURE is requested/required for stubs.
- No refinement file is required for stubs.
- Coder/Validator MUST NOT start work from a stub.
- When activating a stub into a real WP, follow `.GOV/roles/orchestrator/ORCHESTRATOR_PROTOCOL.md` (Technical Refinement Block + USER_SIGNATURE + refinement + `just create-task-packet`).
- If a Base WP later gains multiple packets (revisions), record Base WP -> Active Packet in `.GOV/roles_shared/WP_TRACEABILITY_REGISTRY.md`.
- For any stub covering current-spec Phase 1 roadmap additions (`[ADD v<current>]`), `ROADMAP_ADD_COVERAGE` MUST enumerate the exact spec line numbers so governance checks can verify no additions were missed.

- SPEC_ANCHOR_CANDIDATES (Main Body, not Roadmap):
  - Handshake_Master_Spec_v02.144.md 2.5.9 Thinking Pipeline (Docs ? Canvas ? Workflows)
  - Handshake_Master_Spec_v02.144.md 7.1.2 Freeform Canvas (Milanote-like)

## INTENT (DRAFT)
- What: Backfill Canvas as a governed runtime surface with explicit job/workflow/tool-call visibility, provenance, and operator projection.
- Why: Canvas is central to Thinking Pipeline and Studio, but appendix coverage is still too thin for deterministic future tool/runtime use.

## SCOPE_SKETCH (DRAFT)
- IN_SCOPE:
  - Canvas runtime identity across jobs and governed edits.
  - DCC / Flight Recorder / Locus visibility for canvas-originated actions.
- OUT_OF_SCOPE:
  - Final visual polish.
  - New creative features outside runtime visibility.

## UI_UX_SKETCH (DRAFT)
- Principle: prefer enumerating "too many" controls early, consolidate later.
- Include minimalistic in-UI explainers (prefer hover tooltips), and ensure tooltips are accessible (hover + keyboard focus; dismissible; avoid violating WCAG 1.4.13).
- UI_SURFACES:
  - <fill; screens/panels/dialogs/menus>
- UI_CONTROLS (buttons/dropdowns/inputs):
  - Control: <fill> | Type: <fill> | Tooltip: <fill> | Notes: <fill>
- UI_STATES (empty/loading/error):
  - <fill>
- UI_MICROCOPY_NOTES (labels, helper text, hover explainers):

## ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA (DRAFT)
- Canvas has explicit runtime and operator visibility mapping.
- UI controls enumerate handoff and trace inspection flows.

## DEPENDENCIES / BLOCKERS (DRAFT)
- Depends on Studio shell semantics, Thinking Pipeline mapping, and DCC visibility conventions.

## RISKS / UNKNOWNs (DRAFT)
- Risk: Canvas remains a visually rich but runtime-opaque island if not backfilled now.

## ACTIVATION_CHECKLIST (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY CODING)
- [ ] Confirm the requirement exists in Master Spec Main Body (not just Roadmap).
- [ ] Draft research scouting across BIG_TECH, UNIVERSITY/PAPER, and GITHUB/OSS sources unless the work is strictly internal/mechanical.
- [ ] Draft pillar force multipliers and primitive-matrix combo candidates; create extra stubs instead of guessing.
- [ ] If refinement is likely to grow the primitive index, feature registry, UI guidance, or interaction matrix, treat activation as a spec-version update flow first, then re-activate the WP against the new `SPEC_CURRENT`.
- [ ] Produce the in-chat Technical Refinement Block (per `.GOV/roles/orchestrator/ORCHESTRATOR_PROTOCOL.md`).
- [ ] Obtain USER_SIGNATURE for the WP.
- [ ] Create `.GOV/refinements/WP-1-Canvas-Runtime-Backfill-v1.md` (approved/signed).
- [ ] Create the official task packet via `just create-task-packet WP-1-Canvas-Runtime-Backfill-v1` (in `.GOV/task_packets/`).
- [ ] Copy relevant scope/acceptance notes from this stub into the official packet.
- [ ] Move `.GOV/roles_shared/TASK_BOARD.md` entry from STUB to Ready for Dev.
