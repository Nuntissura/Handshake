## CURRENT_STATE (AUTHORITATIVE SNAPSHOT; MUTABLE)
Verdict: PASS
Blockers: NONE
Next: NONE

## WP_COMMUNICATIONS (NON-AUTHORITATIVE; REQUIRED FOR NEW PACKETS)
- RULE: The task packet remains authoritative for scope, status, branch/worktree truth, acceptance, and verdict.
- PURPOSE: The per-WP communication folder holds freeform discussion, liveness state, and deterministic receipts for multi-session work.
- COMMUNICATION AUTHORITY RULE:
  - all roles use the packet-declared `WP_COMMUNICATION_DIR`
  - do not improvise role-local inboxes or worktree-local communication authority
  - if there is any dispute about where to write, `WP_COMMUNICATION_DIR` wins
- AUTHORITY SPLIT:
  - `WORKFLOW_AUTHORITY` owns workflow steering and hard gates
  - `TECHNICAL_ADVISOR` is the WP-scoped advisory validator
  - `TECHNICAL_AUTHORITY` owns final technical verdict authority
  - `MERGE_AUTHORITY` owns merge-to-main authority
  - `WP_VALIDATOR_OF_RECORD` and `INTEGRATION_VALIDATOR_OF_RECORD` name the active validator sessions once assigned
- THREAD.md:
  - append-only freeform conversation for Operator, Orchestrator, Coder, and Validator
  - may contain steering, questions, clarifications, and soft coordination
- RUNTIME_STATUS.json:
  - non-authoritative liveness and watch state
  - uses repo-governance runtime states: `submitted | working | input_required | completed | failed | canceled`
  - use for next expected actor, waiting state, validator trigger, heartbeat posture, validation readiness, and bounded review-loop counters
- RECEIPTS.jsonl:
  - append-only deterministic receipt ledger
  - one JSON object per line
  - use for assignment, status, heartbeat, steering, repair, validation, and handoff receipts
- SESSION START + WAKE RULE:
  - only `WORKFLOW_AUTHORITY` may start repo-governed Coder, WP Validator, and Integration Validator sessions
  - primary launch path is `SESSION_HOST_PREFERENCE` via `SESSION_PLUGIN_BRIDGE_ID`
  - if the plugin path fails or times out `SESSION_PLUGIN_MAX_RETRIES_BEFORE_ESCALATION` times for the same role/WP session, `CLI_ESCALATION_HOST_DEFAULT` is allowed as the escalation host
  - `SESSION_PLUGIN_REQUESTS_FILE` and `SESSION_REGISTRY_FILE` are the deterministic launch/watch state for those sessions
- WATCH RULE:
  - primary wake-up channel is `SESSION_WAKE_CHANNEL_PRIMARY`
  - fallback wake-up channel is `SESSION_WAKE_CHANNEL_FALLBACK`
  - do not rely on continuous polling when a watch event can be used
- CONFLICT RULE:
  - if THREAD.md, RUNTIME_STATUS.json, or RECEIPTS.jsonl conflicts with this packet, this packet wins
- LOOP LIMIT RULE:
  - do not exceed `MAX_CODER_REVISION_CYCLES`, `MAX_VALIDATOR_REVIEW_CYCLES`, or `MAX_RELAY_ESCALATION_CYCLES` without explicit Operator steering recorded in the packet or thread
- HEARTBEAT RULE:
  - do not poll continuously
  - update `RUNTIME_STATUS.json` and append a receipt on session start, major phase change, blocker/unblock, handoff, completion, and every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MINUTES` only while active

## SUB_AGENT_DELEGATION (OPTIONAL; OPERATOR-GATED)
- SUB_AGENT_DELEGATION: DISALLOWED
- OPERATOR_APPROVAL_EVIDENCE: N/A
- SUB_AGENT_REASONING_ASSUMPTION: LOW (HARD)
- NOTE: `AGENTIC_MODE: YES` means sub-agent use is explicitly authorized for this WP; `AGENTIC_MODE: NO` means all roles remain single-session.
- RULES (if SUB_AGENT_DELEGATION=ALLOWED):
  - Sub-agents produce draft code only; Primary Coder verifies against SPEC_CURRENT + task packet acceptance criteria before applying.
  - Sub-agents MUST NOT edit any governance surface (`.GOV/**`, including task packets/refinements and `## VALIDATION_REPORTS`).
  - Only Primary Coder runs gates, records EVIDENCE/EVIDENCE_MAPPING/VALIDATION manifest, commits, and hands off.
  - See: `/.GOV/roles/coder/agentic/AGENTIC_PROTOCOL.md` Section 6.
- NOTE: Set `SUB_AGENT_DELEGATION: ALLOWED` only with explicit Operator approval; when ALLOWED, replace `OPERATOR_APPROVAL_EVIDENCE` with the exact approval line from chat.

## TECHNICAL_REFINEMENT (MASTER SPEC)
- REFINEMENT_FILE: .GOV/refinements/WP-1-Loom-Storage-Portability-v1.md
- Rule: Task packet creation is blocked until refinement is complete and signed.

- RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS:
  - A portability packet should preserve one stable API and semantic contract while allowing provider-specific indexing and query plans behind the boundary.
  - Big-tech search systems confirm that richer backend-specific ranking, tokenization, and query expansion can stay behind a stable query surface instead of redefining canonical filter meaning.
  - Typed provenance payloads are more durable than ad hoc search or edge metadata and map well to Loom `source_anchor` export/replay expectations.
  - Recent provenance-indexing research reinforces that explicit source/provenance structures should stay queryable and transport-stable, which matches Handshake's need for durable `LoomSourceAnchor` semantics across storage, export, and replay.
  - Search parity should mean stable filters, result identity, and semantic guarantees, not identical score math across SQLite and PostgreSQL.
  - Backend-specific enhancements are useful, but they must not become the only definition of Loom search or graph behavior while Handshake still promises SQLite-now and PostgreSQL-ready portability.

## SCOPE
- What: Harden Loom block, edge, search, view, source-anchor, migration, and asset-path behavior into one portable backend contract that preserves meaning across SQLite and PostgreSQL implementations.
- Why: The codebase already has Loom implementations on both providers, but parity is not proven by shared conformance tests and the portable contract is still vulnerable to adapter drift. This packet makes the spec's Loom portability law executable and trustworthy for downstream Loom bridge work.

## QUALITY_GATE
### TEST_PLAN
```bash
cargo test -p handshake_core loom
  cargo test -p handshake_core --test storage_conformance
  just gov-check
```

### DONE_MEANS
- Loom block, edge, view, search, and source-anchor semantics remain stable across SQLite and PostgreSQL implementations.
- Portable migrations and down migrations for Loom tables stay replay-safe and provider-neutral.
- Shared Loom conformance tests prove parity for CRUD, dedup, views, search filters, and source-anchor round-trips across both backends.
- Filesystem asset-path layout remains stable and compatible with the portable storage contract.

## LINEAGE_AUDIT (ALL VERSIONS) [CX-580E]
- Required when `WP_ID` includes `-v{N}`.
- List every prior packet for `BASE_WP_ID` (filenames/paths) and state what is preserved vs changed.
- Hard rule: Do not drop prior requirements; carry them forward explicitly.
- If this is not a revision packet, write: `N/A`.

## BOOTSTRAP

- SEARCH_TERMS:
  - create_loom_block
  - create_loom_edge
  - query_loom_view
  - search_loom_blocks
  - LoomSourceAnchor
  - LoomViewFilters
  - LoomSearchFilters
  - loom_blocks
  - loom_edges
  - loom_blocks_fts
- RUN_COMMANDS:
  ```bash
rg -n "create_loom_block|create_loom_edge|query_loom_view|search_loom_blocks|LoomSourceAnchor|LoomViewFilters|LoomSearchFilters|loom_blocks|loom_edges|loom_blocks_fts" src/backend/handshake_core
  cargo test -p handshake_core loom
  cargo test -p handshake_core --test storage_conformance
  just gov-check
  ```
- RISK_MAP:
  - "provider-specific search logic changes filter meaning" -> "view and search parity break across SQLite and PostgreSQL"
  - "source anchors fail to round-trip on one backend" -> "backlinks, context snippets, and downstream bridge packets lose stable provenance"
  - "filesystem asset-path layout drifts from storage metadata" -> "export, replay, and dedup behavior become unreliable"
  - "Loom portability work widens into workflow-runtime changes" -> "packet loses file-lock isolation and becomes harder to validate"
## SKELETON
- Proposed interfaces/types/contracts:
- Open questions:
- Notes:

## UI_UX_SPEC (REQUIRED IF UI_UX_APPLICABLE=YES)
- UI_UX_APPLICABLE=NO in the signed refinement. No user-facing surface is in scope for this packet.

## END_TO_END_CLOSURE_PLAN [CX-E2E-001]
- END_TO_END_CLOSURE_PLAN_APPLICABLE: NO
- REASON_NO: This packet is a backend portability and conformance activation pass; no separate bootstrap-time end-to-end closure plan is required beyond the signed scope, DONE_MEANS, and validator checks.

## IMPLEMENTATION
- (Coder fills after the docs-only skeleton checkpoint commit exists.)

## HYGIENE
- (Coder fills after implementation; list activities and commands run. Outcomes may be summarized here, but detailed logs should go in ## EVIDENCE.)

## VALIDATION
- (Mechanical manifest for audit. Fill real values to enable 'just post-work'. This section records the 'What' (hashes/lines) for the Validator's 'How/Why' audit. It is NOT a claim of official Validation.)
- If the WP changes multiple non-`.GOV/` files, repeat the manifest block once per changed file (multiple `**Target File**` entries are supported).
- SHA1 hint: stage your changes and run `just cor701-sha <target-file>` to get deterministic `Pre-SHA1` / `Post-SHA1` values.
- **Target File**: `N/A until implementation begins`
- **Start**: <line>
- **End**: <line>
- **Line Delta**: <adds - dels>
- **Pre-SHA1**: `<hash>`
- **Post-SHA1**: `<hash>`

## STATUS_HANDOFF
- (Use this to list touched files and summarize work done without claiming a validation verdict. Mirror freeform discussion and liveness into the WP communication folder when present.)
- Current WP_STATUS:
- What changed in this update:
- Next step / handoff hint:

## EVIDENCE_MAPPING
- (Coder appends proof that DONE_MEANS + SPEC_ANCHOR requirements exist in code/tests. No verdicts.)
- Format (repeat as needed):
  - REQUIREMENT: "<quote DONE_MEANS bullet or SPEC_ANCHOR requirement>"
  - EVIDENCE: `N/A until implementation begins`

## EVIDENCE
- (Coder appends logs, test outputs, and proof of work here. No verdicts.)
- Recommended evidence format (prevents chat truncation; enables audit):
  - COMMAND: `<paste>`
  - EXIT_CODE: `<int>`
  - LOG_PATH: `.handshake/logs/WP-1-Loom-Storage-Portability-v1/<name>.log` (recommended; not committed)
  - LOG_SHA256: `<hash>`
  - PROOF_LINES: `<copy/paste 1-10 critical lines (e.g., "0 failed", "PASS")>`

## VALIDATION_REPORTS
- (Validator appends official audits and verdicts here. Append-only.)
