## Target

document.new as a RUN_COMMANDS row and CLI verb: a blank vector, raster, design or layout document at a stated size, plus add, name, resize and delete of artboards and pages with state projection. First step of every design scene.

Why this lane: the eight professional project scenarios in `S/workflows/scenario-*.json` show engines that exist and cannot be reached. This row of `S/workflows/backlog-20261107.json` ranks it: steps unblocked 10, scenarios {"board-slides-web": 4, "product-design": 3, "vector-brand": 3}. Read that row and the scenario steps it unblocks: they are your acceptance. A step is done when a model can run it through a command, in the JSONL loop of `harness/src/cli/drive.rs` once SMB-HARNESS-DRIVE-1 lands, and the result reaches save and export.

Facts verified at c4d06841 by the backlog agent, read-only, not run. Treat them as claims and check them:
- hsk-studio-harness-core/src/action.rs:865 document.open is the only document start row; git grep new_document, new_project, studio.document.new, new_blank over harness, harness-core, harness-view, session: no entry point
- hsk-studio-harness-view/src/view/shell.rs:1590 blank_layout_doc is the only blank, used at shell.rs:1386
- hsk-studio-folio/src/lib.rs:207, :217 artboards: Vec<StudioArtboard> exists; git grep artboards.push, add_artboard, set_artboard: 0 hits
- hsk-studio-session/src/composition_token.rs:236 new_document_composition_entry exists for a new document

Depends on: []. If a dependency is not on origin yet, build what does not need it and tell the lead what waits.

How to work:
1. Read the code first. Use the spec's names and cite clauses (`.GOV/spec/master-spec-v02.229/spec-modules/14-studio-creative-suite.md`). Use only names already in the spec, MTs or code.
2. Red test and focused test per item. Engine, command and test: no draw code and no panel. The GUI is being rebuilt in pure Vulkan, and a panel lane will call your command.
3. Commands register in the existing catalog (`RUN_COMMANDS` in `harness-core/src/action.rs`, or a `viewer.<method>` row) with typed parameters and typed refusals. Each mutating command is one named undo step, carries the caller's attribution, and survives save and reopen.
4. V4-06: a short list of sibling sites, fixed or named. Hostile input: bounded work and allocation, typed refusals, no panic.
5. About 5 commits. Width over polish. State what you cut.
MTs: read those your slice proves and name them in your report; the lead records them. Do not edit MT files.

Out of scope: panels, drawing, RF-01, render-gpu, any Cargo.lock change without asking the lead.

OPERATOR DIRECTION, 2026-11-07 (HANDOFF topic workflow, items 9 to 12): rapid implementation, width and depth first. Minimal testing: red test and focused tests per item, one bundled run, no busy work. Message the lead with your tip before the bundled run, so review agents inspect it first. Tree: this lane reuses a completed lane's worktree and cargo target (Codex CX-GIT-001A, root HSK-ART-005); the folder name and `--owner` are the old lane's; your branch, log names and records are this lane's. No new egui, eframe, winit, wgpu, naga or WGSL line (D1, D7). No Master Spec edit. Never touch WP-KERNEL-012 files. Never touch refund-claim-20261021.md.

## Owned paths (lane worktree `wt-studio-lanes/smb-ai-distort-effects-1`, branch `lane/smb-doc-new-1`, base c4d06841)

hsk-studio-harness-core/src/action.rs (one row beside :865); hsk-studio-harness/src/cli.rs (one verb); hsk-studio-harness-view/src/view/shell.rs:1590 (blank_layout_doc stays the layout case); hsk-studio-harness-view/src/view/document_new.rs (new, egui-free); hsk-studio-harness/tests/document_new.rs (new)

<topic id="proof" status="active" summary="Proof and run order">

## Proof

- Red first per item, proven red by running it; keep compiling red commits, a pushed red commit must compile the round units of the changed crates and direct dependents and fail only its own new tests.
- One bundled run on D: (`lane-check.sh --owner smb-ai-distort-effects-1 --disk d`): step 0; the suites of the crates you edit, with named targets only for harness and harness-view unless you edit their src; doctests if added.
- Before that bundled run, message the lead with your tip: read-only code-check and red-team agents inspect the diff first (HANDOFF topic workflow, item 10). Until then use `cargo check` and focused tests only, through `lane-check.sh` or a shell that sourced `builders/studio-env.sh`. A repo-local `target/` is a governance violation.
- Push when that run is green: rebase on `origin/codex/handshake-studio-assets`, `lane-check.sh --owner smb-ai-distort-effects-1 --disk d --per-sha HEAD~1` (the tip only, item 11), push on `PER_SHA_RESULT OK` with the guarded sha form.
- If origin moves after your bundled run: when the commits touch none of your crates, rebase, `--per-sha`, your new tests only, push; when they touch one of your crates, run that crate's suite once, then the same. Do not repeat whole runs for a move. The next full round proves the union.
- Set READY_FOR_VALIDATION on a pushed commit. Never claim PASS.
