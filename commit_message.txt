feat: implement Codex v0.8 AI-autonomous workflow and Phase 1 core tasks

Upgrade from Codex v0.7 to v0.8 with deterministic enforcement for AI-autonomous
software engineering. Non-technical users now have guaranteed workflow compliance.
This commit also includes all Phase 1 core backend infrastructure, frontend
build fixes, and the first frontend AI action implementation.

Key Changes (Codex v0.8 Implementation):
- SHOULD→MUST for critical workflow steps (task packets, validation, logger)
- Created orchestrator/coder protocol files with blocking checklists
- Added pre-work/post-work validation scripts (exit 1 on failure)
- Implemented justfile commands: create-task-packet, pre-work, post-work
- Added Gate 0 (pre-work) and Gate 1 (post-work) to QUALITY_GATE.md
- Enhanced pre-commit hook with comprehensive checks
- Added CI traceability job validating WP_IDs and logger entries
- Created docs/task_packets/ directory for task packet storage
- Moved protocol files from .claude/ to docs/ (as per addendum)
- Formalized User Expertise directive in Codex [CX-504]
- Formalized TASK_BOARD.md in Codex [CX-217]

Phase 1 Core Backend Infrastructure [WP-1-AI-Core-Backend]:
- Implemented AI Jobs and Workflow Run tables in SQLite
- Integrated DuckDB-backed Flight Recorder
- Created POST /api/jobs endpoint
- Fixed related compiler errors and warnings

Frontend Build Fixes [WP-1-Frontend-Build-Debug]:
- Resolved all TypeScript build failures (missing Vitest types, Excalidraw branding, etc.)

Frontend AI Action Implementation [WP-1-Frontend-AI-Action]:
- Added `createJob` API helper and `WorkflowRun` type (app/src/lib/api.ts)
- Implemented "Run AI Job" button in `DocumentView.tsx`
- Expanded `DebugEventType` (app/src/state/debugEvents.ts)
- Fixed "can't interact" bug by stopping auto-selection/reset behavior in `WorkspaceSidebar.tsx`
- Implemented layout shifts fix in `App.tsx` and `App.css`

Documentation & Process Improvements:
- Added warning for AI agents about running long-lived servers in `docs/START_HERE.md` and `docs/RUNBOOK_DEBUG.md`.
- Implemented `docs/TASK_BOARD.md` for high-level task tracking.
- Updated `docs/ORCHESTRATOR_PROTOCOL.md` and `docs/CODER_PROTOCOL.md` to reflect new task board and status management.
- Renamed Handshake_logger to `Handshake_logger_20251218.md`

VALIDATION:
✅ Codex v0.8 workflow implemented and tested (WP-Test-Sample).
✅ Backend AI job endpoint confirmed functional.
✅ Frontend build confirmed fixed.
✅ Frontend AI button confirmed functional and resolved "can't interact" bug.
