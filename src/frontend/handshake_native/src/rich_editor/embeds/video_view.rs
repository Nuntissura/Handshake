//! Video embed renderer (WP-KERNEL-012 MT-014).
//!
//! ## KNOWN LIMITATION (deliberate, documented): no in-process video decode
//!
//! Full in-process video decode is OUT OF SCOPE for this MT. It requires a media decoder crate
//! (e.g. `symphonia` + ffmpeg bindings) and is deferred to a future MT. Here a `video` embed
//! renders a POSTER/PLACEHOLDER: the asset's thumbnail (poster) when available, a play-button
//! overlay, the original filename, and the content URL as VISIBLE TEXT so the operator can
//! inspect exactly what would play (red-team RISK-4 / minimum-control: show the content URL).
//!
//! ## HBR-QUIET: no automatic external app launch, no focus theft
//!
//! The MT scope text floated `open::that()` (the `open` crate) to launch the OS default media
//! player on click. The KERNEL_BUILDER gate + the MT-010 finding REJECT that as the DEFAULT:
//! `open::that()` launches an external OS app and STEALS FOCUS — a direct HBR-QUIET violation —
//! and it NEVER fires on render. So:
//!   - The DEFAULT play action is the in-app placeholder ([`VideoActivation::ShowUrlInline`]):
//!     it reveals the content URL inline and steals NO focus. No `open` crate is added.
//!   - A play CLICK is dispatched through a mockable [`VideoPlayHandler`] (NOT a hard
//!     `open::that()`), so AC-7 ("clicking the play button calls the play handler with the
//!     content URL") is proven with a counted mock WITHOUT focus theft and WITHOUT a new crate.
//!   - OS-open via `open::that()` remains an OPTIONAL, EXPLICIT-click-only future addition that
//!     would be a reviewed HBR-QUIET exception; it is intentionally NOT implemented here, so the
//!     `open` dependency is intentionally absent (NEVER auto-open on render).
