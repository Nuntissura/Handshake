//! Breakpoint model + the debug-adapter publish event for the native code editor (WP-KERNEL-012
//! MT-007 — E1 code editor gutter).
//!
//! ## What this owns
//!
//! - [`BreakpointSet`] — the set of buffer lines that carry a breakpoint, behind a `HashSet<usize>`
//!   so a toggle is O(1) and the set never holds a duplicate line. The gutter renders a filled red
//!   circle on every line in this set and a click toggles it.
//! - [`BreakpointEvent`] — the typed message the [`CodeEditorPanel`](super::panel::CodeEditorPanel)
//!   publishes when a breakpoint is set or cleared, so a FUTURE debug-adapter-protocol (DAP) client
//!   MT can consume it and forward `setBreakpoints` to the debuggee. This MT does NOT implement the
//!   DAP client; it only prepares the publish channel.
//!
//! ## Why a non-blocking, discard-on-disconnect publish (RISK-003 / MC-003)
//!
//! The DAP client is a future MT, so the receiver may not exist yet (or may have been dropped). The
//! MT red-team RISK-003 names `try_send`, but `std::sync::mpsc::Sender` has NO `try_send` — `try_send`
//! belongs to `SyncSender` on a BOUNDED channel. The KERNEL_BUILDER gate note in the MT contract
//! resolves this: the real intent is "non-blocking + discard on a dropped receiver", which an
//! UNBOUNDED `std::sync::mpsc::channel()` + `Sender::send(event).ok()` satisfies exactly — an unbounded
//! `send` never blocks, and `.ok()` discards the `Err` returned when the receiver was dropped. The
//! panel guards every publish with `if let Some(sender) = &self.breakpoint_sender { sender.send(event).ok(); }`
//! so a missing/disconnected DAP client is a benign no-op, never a hang. This mirrors the existing
//! [`event_bus`](crate::event_bus) "bus before producer" shape already proven in the WP-011 shell.
