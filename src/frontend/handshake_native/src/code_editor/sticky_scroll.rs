//! Sticky scroll (WP-KERNEL-012 MT-053, E1 — VS Code parity).
//!
//! VS Code's `editor.stickyScroll`: while the user scrolls inside a function / class / impl block / other
//! nested scope, the signature/declaration lines of every ENCLOSING scope stay pinned at the top of the
//! editor viewport, so the context of the first visible line is always readable.
//!
//! ## Pure reuse layer — no re-parse, no backend (RISK-002 / MC-002, AC-007)
//!
//! This module owns NO scope model and performs NO parse. It INTERSECTS the MT-005
//! [`FoldRegion`](super::folding::FoldRegion) list (the enclosing-scope ranges, from the SAME tree the
//! highlighter built) with the live buffer to read each scope's literal declaration line. It constructs
//! no parser and makes no backend call (a grep gate, AC-007, proves both absences over the shipped code).
//!
//! ## The computation (MT step 4 / RISK-006 / MC-006)
//!
//! A scope is STICKY for a given `viewport_top_line` when it strictly encloses that line:
//! `region.start_line <= viewport_top_line < region.end_line`. (The `< end_line` — not `<=` — means a
//! scope whose closing line is exactly the first visible line is NO LONGER pinned: you have scrolled past
//! it, matching VS Code.) The enclosing scopes are returned OUTERMOST-FIRST (smallest `start_line`), and
//! the count is CAPPED at [`StickyScrollConfig::max_sticky_lines`] (default 5, VS Code parity) so a deeply
//! nested file cannot pin headers that consume the whole viewport. When the cap truncates, the INNERMOST
//! scopes are kept (VS Code keeps the closest context, dropping the outermost) — the header you most need
//! is the function you are inside, not the top-level module.
//!
//! The header TEXT is the LITERAL source declaration line sliced from the buffer (MT-002
//! `slice_to_string`), trimmed of trailing whitespace — NOT a label reconstructed from a symbol node, so
//! `fn main() {` reads exactly as written (impl note / contract step 4).
