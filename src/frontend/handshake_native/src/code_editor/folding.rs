//! Code folding derived from the tree-sitter parse tree (WP-KERNEL-012 MT-005, E1 — VS Code parity).
//!
//! Foldable regions are identified from tree-sitter node KINDS (function bodies, class bodies, block
//! statements, comment groups, …) rather than from indentation or brace matching, so the fold source
//! is the SAME language-aware syntax tree MT-001's highlighter already builds (Monaco folds the same
//! way internally). This MT only COMPUTES the fold regions and applies them to the virtual line
//! layout; the gutter that paints the fold triangles is MT-007.
//!
//! ## The three pieces
//!
//! - [`FoldableNodeTypes`] — the per-language set of node kinds that produce a fold region, keyed by
//!   language id (`"rust"` / `"javascript"`). Stored as a `HashMap<&'static str, &'static [&'static
//!   str]>` exactly as the MT contract specifies, so adding a language is a one-line table edit.
//! - [`FoldProvider::compute`] — walks the parse tree with a `tree_sitter::TreeCursor`
//!   (`tree.walk()`, NOT recursion — avoids stack overflow on deeply nested trees, MT impl note 1),
//!   emits a [`FoldRegion`] for every node whose kind is foldable AND spans >= 2 lines, clamps every
//!   row to the live buffer (RISK-003 / MC-002: tolerate a tree that lags a fast edit by one frame),
//!   and merges regions that share a start line so an outer block and its trailing brace do not stack
//!   two identical folds (RISK-002).
//! - [`FoldSet`] — the runtime fold state: which regions exist, which are folded, and the two queries
//!   the renderer needs ([`is_line_visible`](FoldSet::is_line_visible) and
//!   [`visible_line_to_buffer_line`](FoldSet::visible_line_to_buffer_line)). The visible→buffer
//!   mapping is cached as a `Vec<usize>` and rebuilt only when the fold state changes (RISK-001 /
//!   MC-001), so the render hot loop never pays O(N folds) per visible line.
//!
//! ## Nested folds (MT impl note 4)
//!
//! A fold region can contain inner fold regions. When the OUTER region is folded, all of its lines
//! (including any inner regions) are hidden, regardless of the inner regions' own folded flags — the
//! outer fold wins. Toggling the outer fold does not change the inner folds' state, so expanding the
//! outer restores whatever inner fold state was set before. [`is_line_visible`](FoldSet::is_line_visible)
//! implements this by scanning for the FIRST (outermost) folded region that hides a line; that is
//! enough because [`FoldProvider::compute`] sorts regions by `(start_line, -span)` so an enclosing
//! region always precedes the regions it contains.
