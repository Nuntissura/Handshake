//! Editor jump history — the back/forward navigation stack (WP-KERNEL-012 MT-052 — E1 GO-menu).
//!
//! This module is the pure, egui-free core behind **Navigate Back (Alt+Left)** and **Navigate Forward
//! (Alt+Right)**. It records cursor positions across files whenever the user performs a NAVIGATION JUMP
//! (go-to-definition, find-references result open, symbol/outline jump, goto-line) and lets the user walk
//! that stack backward/forward, restoring the prior file + position — VS Code's editor-navigation stack.
//!
//! ## VS Code semantics (the four behaviors that matter)
//!
//! 1. **Cross-file** ([`JumpEntry`] carries its own `file_path`): Navigate Back can restore a position in
//!    a DIFFERENT file than the one currently focused (AC-004 / RISK-005). The stack is not per-file.
//! 2. **Forward-tail truncation** (RISK-004 / MC-004): making a NEW jump while the history cursor is not
//!    at the tail (i.e. after some Backs) DISCARDS the forward entries before pushing — so Navigate
//!    Forward never jumps to a stale, unrelated location.
//! 3. **Coalescing**: consecutive [`record`](JumpHistory::record)s pointing at the same file within a
//!    small line tolerance ([`COALESCE_LINE_TOLERANCE`]) collapse, so trivial cursor moves do not flood
//!    the stack. Only navigation jumps call `record` (the panel wires `record` at the four jump dispatch
//!    sites only — NOT typing/arrow moves, RISK-006 / MC-006).
//! 4. **Cap** ([`MAX_ENTRIES`]): the stack is capped, dropping the OLDEST entry when full.
//!
//! ## Cursor model
//!
//! [`JumpHistory`] keeps a `Vec<JumpEntry>` and a `cursor` index that is the position the user is
//! "currently at" within the history. [`back`](JumpHistory::back) moves the cursor toward the past and
//! returns the prior location (recording the CURRENT location so Forward can return to it);
//! [`forward`](JumpHistory::forward) moves toward the future. This is in-memory SESSION state only — no
//! PostgreSQL/EventLedger persistence (the MT is pure frontend; jump positions come from in-process
//! editor cursor state).
