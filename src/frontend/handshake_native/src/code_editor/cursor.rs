//! Multi-cursor + column/box selection model for the native code editor (WP-KERNEL-012 MT-003).
//!
//! This module owns the EDITING-INTENT state that sits on top of the [`TextBuffer`](super::buffer::TextBuffer):
//! a set of cursors, each a `(anchor, head)` byte-offset pair. It is the native analog of the Monaco
//! multi-cursor behavior the React surface gets for free, reimplemented over our own buffer because we
//! own the text and render it manually (the MT rule: never `egui::TextEdit`).
//!
//! ## Field-converged model (research provenance wf_ffa74d6d)
//!
//! [`Cursor`] = `{ anchor, head }` byte offsets and [`CursorSet`] = `Vec<Cursor>` IS the Helix
//! `Selection` model the research converged on — kept verbatim. A cursor whose `anchor == head` is a
//! bare caret; a cursor whose `anchor != head` is a [`Selection`] (a range). `head` is the moving end
//! (where typing/extension happens); `anchor` is the fixed end. This matches VS Code / Monaco /
//! Helix / CodeMirror, so the same keybindings produce the same results.
//!
//! ## Invariants (enforced after EVERY mutation)
//!
//! 1. Every `anchor`/`head` is clamped to `0..=buffer.len_bytes()` and snapped to a char boundary —
//!    an out-of-range or mid-char offset (from a stale span, an agent action, or a deserialized
//!    cursor) is impossible to store (implementation note 1; RISK-002 alignment).
//! 2. The set is kept sorted by `head` (then `anchor`) so render order, AccessKit node order, and the
//!    reverse-order edit walk are all deterministic.
//! 3. Overlapping cursors are merged ([`CursorSet::remove_overlap`]) so two cursors can never edit the
//!    same span twice.
//!
//! [`CursorSet::normalize`] re-establishes all three after any change; the public mutators call it so a
//! caller cannot leave the set in a broken state.
//!
//! ## Edit-time offset drift (RISK-001 — the off-by-N trap)
//!
//! Inserting/deleting at cursor *i* shifts every later byte offset. [`CursorSet::insert_at_all`] and
//! [`CursorSet::delete_at_all`] therefore process cursors in REVERSE order by `head` (largest offset
//! first) so an earlier edit never invalidates a later cursor's stored offset, and they additionally
//! re-shift the surviving cursors by the byte delta so the cursors END UP at the position right after
//! their own inserted/deleted text. A dedicated unit test pins this (AC-001 / AC-006 / MC-001).
