//! Unicode-correct word + character counts for the editor footers (WP-KERNEL-012 MT-077).
//!
//! The MT-019 daily-notes footer counted words by splitting on whitespace and characters by Unicode
//! scalar (`char`). Both are wrong for international text:
//!
//! - **Word count.** A Chinese sentence has NO spaces (`今天我写了很多字`), so whitespace tokenization
//!   reports it as ONE "word" — meaningless. [`word_count`] uses UAX#29 word boundaries
//!   (`unicode-segmentation::unicode_words`), which yields word-like tokens: each CJK ideograph/run is
//!   counted as the standard treats it, Latin/Cyrillic/Greek words are whole words, and punctuation /
//!   whitespace are not counted as words.
//!
//!   DOCUMENTED RULE (AC5): a "word" is a UAX#29 word per `unicode_words()`. For a mixed string like
//!   `"Hello 世界 test"` this counts `Hello`, `世`, `界`, `test` = **4** — the two Latin words plus the
//!   two CJK ideographs (UAX#29 treats each Han ideograph as its own word, the standard behavior all
//!   CJK-aware editors use; there is no whitespace inside `世界` to merge them and Han has no
//!   word-internal joiners). This is the sensible, defined count CJK users expect (a 2-character Chinese
//!   word region contributes 2, matching per-character CJK counting in editors like VS Code / Word's
//!   "Chinese characters" count).
//!
//! - **Character count.** A family ZWJ emoji is 7 scalars but ONE user-perceived character. [`char_count`]
//!   counts GRAPHEME CLUSTERS (UAX#29 extended graphemes), so the family emoji = 1, `e`+combining-accent
//!   = 1, a flag = 1, a Hangul syllable = 1. DOCUMENTED CHOICE (AC6 / RISK-3): grapheme clusters, NOT
//!   scalars and NOT UTF-16 units. Rationale: grapheme = what a human counts as "one character", which
//!   is what a writer expects from a character count. (If a backend ever needs a scalar or UTF-16 count
//!   to match a stored value, that is a separate, explicitly-named count — this footer count is the
//!   human-facing grapheme count.)
