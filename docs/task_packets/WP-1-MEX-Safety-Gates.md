## ๐ต๏ธ CODE ARCHAEOLOGY NOTE
**Reason:** Strategic Audit for Phase 1 closure.
**Authority [CX-598]:** The Roadmap is only a pointer. The **Master Spec Main Body** (ยง1-6, ยง9-11) is the sole definition of "Done."
**Procedure:** 
1. Validator must search for MEX v1.2 implementations.
2. Verify implementation matches **100% of the technical rules, schemas, and invariants** found in the Main Body (ยง11.8 Mechanical Extension / ยง6.3.0 Envelopes).
3. Surface-level compliance with roadmap bullets (ยง7.6.3.10) is insufficient. Every line of text in the Main Body section must be implemented.
4. If 100% alignment exists -> **PASS**. Otherwise -> **FAIL**.

## SCOPE
- **What**: Implement MEX v1.2 Safety Gates (Guard, Container, Quota).
- **Why**: Prevent secrets leakage and resource exhaustion during automated command execution.
- **SPEC_ANCHOR**: ยง7.6.3.10

## RISK_TIER
- Level: HIGH
- Rationale: Spec-governed audit; failure blocks Phase 1 closure.

## TEST_PLAN
`ash
just validator-spec-regression
just validator-scan WP-1-MEX-Safety-Gates
just validator-hygiene-full
`

## DONE_MEANS
- Spec requirements from referenced anchors are fully implemented or gaps recorded with FAIL.
- Forbidden-pattern audit is clean or explicitly justified.
- TEST_PLAN commands executed and outputs captured in the validation report.
- Evidence mapping lists file:line for every requirement.

## BOOTSTRAP
- FILES_TO_OPEN:
  * docs/SPEC_CURRENT.md
  * Handshake_Master_Spec_v02.84.md
  * docs/TASK_BOARD.md
- SEARCH_TERMS:
  * "WP-1-MEX-Safety-Gates"
  * spec anchor keywords
- RUN_COMMANDS:
  `ash
  just validator-spec-regression
  just validator-scan WP-1-MEX-Safety-Gates
  `
- RISK_MAP:
  * "Spec mismatch" -> validate SPEC_CURRENT and anchors
  * "Placeholder evidence" -> block until file:line mapping exists
  * "Forbidden patterns" -> run validator-scan and fix findings

## AUTHORITY
- SPEC_CURRENT: Handshake_Master_Spec_v02.84.md
- Codex: Handshake Codex v1.4.md
- Task Board: docs/TASK_BOARD.md\n\n## EVIDENCE_MAPPING
- [Requirement] -> [File:Line]


## VALIDATION REPORT  WP-1-MEX-Safety-Gates
Verdict: FAIL

Scope Inputs:
- Task Packet: docs/task_packets/WP-1-MEX-Safety-Gates.md (status: Ready for Dev)
- Spec: - **SPEC_ANCHOR**: ยง7.6.3.10

Findings:
- Packet incomplete [CX-573]: missing required fields (RISK_TIER, TEST_PLAN, DONE_MEANS, BOOTSTRAP, AUTHORITY); USER_SIGNATURE pending. Pre-flight gate blocks validation.
- No implementation evidence provided; validation halted until packet completeness and evidence mapping exist.

Hygiene / Forbidden Patterns:
- Not run (blocked by pre-flight failure).

Tests:
- Not run (TEST_PLAN missing).

Reason for FAIL:
- Workflow pre-flight failed; WP returned to Ready for Dev pending packet completion and implementation evidence.




## VALIDATION REPORT  WP-1-MEX-Safety-Gates (2025-12-25)
Verdict: FAIL

Scope Inputs:
- Task Packet: docs/task_packets/WP-1-MEX-Safety-Gates.md (status: Ready for Dev)
- Spec: Handshake_Master_Spec_v02.84.md (ง7.6.3.10, MEX v1.2 Safety Gates)

Files Checked:
- Search: rg -n "MEX|Mechanical|Guard" src/backend/handshake_core/src

Spec Requirements (excerpted):
- Mechanical Extension Safety Gates (Guard, Container, Quota) enforcing capability, sandboxing, quotas, and provenance; integration with Workflow Engine/Flight Recorder; conformance harness/tests.

Findings:
- No MEX safety gate implementations, guards, or sandbox/quota logic found in backend.
- No integration with Workflow Engine or Flight Recorder for MEX gating.

Hygiene / Forbidden Patterns:
- Not run; no implementation exists.

Tests:
- None executed; no MEX gate tests present.

Reason for FAIL:
- MEX safety gates required by spec are absent.
