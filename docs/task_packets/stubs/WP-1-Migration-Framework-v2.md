# Task Packet Stub: WP-1-Migration-Framework-v2

**Status:** STUB (Not Activated)

## Identity
- WP_ID: WP-1-Migration-Framework-v2
- BASE_WP_ID: WP-1-Migration-Framework
- Created: 2026-01-11
- SPEC_TARGET: docs/SPEC_CURRENT.md (currently Handshake_Master_Spec_v02.106.md)

## Why this stub exists
This is an additive remediation stub for `WP-1-Migration-Framework`.

It is created because the prior packet failed revalidation and/or has audit gaps.

## Prior packet
- Prior WP_ID: `WP-1-Migration-Framework`
- Prior packet: `docs/task_packets/WP-1-Migration-Framework.md`

## Known gaps (Task Board summary)
- / FAIL (revalidation): Phase 1 closure prerequisite (CX-DBP-030); revalidate against SPEC_CURRENT (packet has historical status/spec drift vs current governance gates). [READY FOR DEV]

## Activation checklist (before any coding)
1. In-chat Technical Refinement Block (per `docs/ORCHESTRATOR_PROTOCOL.md` Part 2.5.2).
2. USER_SIGNATURE.
3. Create `docs/refinements/WP-1-Migration-Framework-v2.md`.
4. Create official task packet via `just create-task-packet WP-1-Migration-Framework-v2`.
5. Update `docs/WP_TRACEABILITY_REGISTRY.md` to point `WP-1-Migration-Framework` -> `WP-1-Migration-Framework-v2`.
6. Update `docs/TASK_BOARD.md` to move `WP-1-Migration-Framework-v2` out of STUB when activated.
