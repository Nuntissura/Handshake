## TECHNICAL_REFINEMENT (MASTER SPEC)
- REFINEMENT_FILE: docs/refinements/WP-1-Micro-Task-Executor-v1.md
- Rule: Task packet creation is blocked until refinement is complete and signed.

## SCOPE
- What: Implement the backend Micro-Task Executor Profile (profile_id=`micro_task_executor_v1`) MVP per Master Spec 2.6.6.8: auto-generate MT definitions from WP scope, execute the MicroTaskExecutionLoop with fresh-context-per-iteration, route validations through the Mechanical Tool Bus (PlannedOperation/EngineResult) with capability checks, persist ProgressArtifact+RunLedger for crash recovery, implement the default escalation chain including HARD_GATE, and emit the required Flight Recorder events including distillation-candidate capture (logging-only; no training).
- Why: Enables deterministic, auditable, crash-recoverable agentic execution for complex work packets using bounded iterations and governance-safe tool invocation (unblocks Phase 1 execution automation and reduces "vibe loop" risk).
- IN_SCOPE_PATHS:
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/workflows.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/flight_recorder/mod.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/flight_recorder/duckdb.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/ace/mod.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/mex/runtime.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/mex/envelope.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/storage/mod.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/storage/sqlite.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/src/storage/postgres.rs
  - src/backend/handshake_core/tests/micro_task_executor_tests.rs (new)
- OUT_OF_SCOPE:
  - Any LoRA training, model promotion, or automated distillation job execution (Phase 2+ only).
  - MT parallel wave execution (Phase 4).
  - Cloud escalation governance/policy (Phase 4).
  - Spec enrichment / spec edits (implement against current anchors).

## WAIVERS GRANTED

## QUALITY_GATE
### TEST_PLAN
```bash
# Run before handoff:
just pre-work WP-1-Micro-Task-Executor-v1

# Targeted backend tests (add/update as needed):
cargo test --manifest-path src/backend/handshake_core/Cargo.toml

# Governance and workflow gates:
just validator-scan
just validator-spec-regression
just cargo-clean
just post-work WP-1-Micro-Task-Executor-v1
```

### DONE_MEANS
- A WorkflowRun job with `profile_id="micro_task_executor_v1"` executes the Micro-Task Executor path (not the default workflow_run path), and the MT loop starts with FR evidence for: loop_started, iteration_started/complete, validation, escalation/hard_gate, and loop_completed/failed as applicable.
- MT definitions are generated by the system from WP scope (not user-supplied MT definitions); the implementation does not expose an API surface where a user manually provides MT definitions for execution.
- Validation commands are executed via the Mechanical Tool Bus using a PlannedOperation envelope (engine.shell exec), with capability checks, and emit FR-EVT-MT-012 micro_task_validation.
- ProgressArtifact and RunLedger are persisted with idempotency keys and resume_point support; crash recovery restores/marks in_progress steps and resumes from the first pending/failed step.
- Crash recovery emits FR-EVT-WF-RECOVERY (WorkflowRecoveryEvent) with required schema fields (actor=system) and includes enough reason/context to correlate to the recovered MT run.
- Default escalation chain is enforced (7b -> 7b-alt -> 13b -> 13b-alt -> 32b -> HARD_GATE); escalation emits FR-EVT-MT-005 and HARD_GATE emits FR-EVT-MT-006 and pauses execution.
- When `policy.enable_distillation=true` and escalation occurs, the system generates a DistillationCandidate artifact and emits FR-EVT-MT-015; no training occurs in this WP.

## LINEAGE_AUDIT (ALL VERSIONS) [CX-580E]
- Prior packet artifacts:
  - docs/task_packets/stubs/WP-1-Micro-Task-Executor-v1.md (stub; not executable)
- Changes in this v1 activation:
  - Activated as an official task packet anchored to SPEC_CURRENT (v02.115) and the signed refinement file.
  - Scope focuses on Phase 1 MVP: MT loop controller + validation wiring + persistence + escalation/hard-gate + distillation candidate capture (no training).

- RISK_MAP:
  - "infinite loop" -> "executor never terminates; burns iterations/cost"
  - "capability bypass" -> "validations run outside tool bus; no evidence or gates"
  - "anti-gaming failure" -> "model claims completion without evidence; system trusts it"
  - "crash recovery loss" -> "no deterministic resume; repeats or corrupts state"
  - "log/schema drift" -> "FR events emitted but not queryable/traceable in consoles"

## IMPLEMENTATION
- (Coder fills after skeleton approval.)

## HYGIENE
- (Coder fills after implementation; list activities and commands run. Outcomes may be summarized here, but detailed logs should go in ## EVIDENCE.)

## VALIDATION
- (Mechanical manifest for audit. Fill real values to enable 'just post-work'. This section records the 'What' (hashes/lines) for the Validator's 'How/Why' audit. It is NOT a claim of official Validation.)
- If the WP changes multiple non-`docs/` files, repeat the manifest block once per changed file (multiple `**Target File**` entries are supported).
- SHA1 hint: stage your changes and run `just cor701-sha path/to/file` to get deterministic `Pre-SHA1` / `Post-SHA1` values.
