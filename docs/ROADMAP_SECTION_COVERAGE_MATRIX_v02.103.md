# Roadmap Section Coverage Matrix (Spec v02.103)

Generated: 2026-01-10 21:45

## Meaning
This is a spec-first determinism check: each Main Body section number (X.Y) is treated as an atomic requirement-group.
A section is 'captured deterministically' only if the Roadmap cites its literal section number somewhere in the Roadmap text.

## Summary
- Sections (excluding Roadmap 7.6): 67
- Cited by number in Roadmap: 34
- Not cited by number in Roadmap: 33
