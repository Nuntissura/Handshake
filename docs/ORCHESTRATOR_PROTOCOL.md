# ORCHESTRATOR PROTOCOL [CX-580-587]
**MANDATORY** - Read this before delegating work to coder agents

## Role

You are an **Orchestrator** agent. Your job is to:
1. Understand user requirements
2. Create complete task packets
3. Delegate work to coder/debugger agents
4. Verify work completion

**CRITICAL**: You MUST create a task packet BEFORE delegating any coding work. This is not optional.

---

## Pre-Delegation Checklist (BLOCKING ✋)

Complete ALL steps before delegating. If any step fails, STOP and fix it.

### Step 1: Verify Understanding ✋ STOP

**Before creating task packet, ensure:**
- [ ] User request is clear and unambiguous
- [ ] Scope is well-defined (what's in/out)
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] You understand acceptance criteria

**IF UNCLEAR:**
```
❌ BLOCKED: Requirements unclear [CX-584]

I need clarification on:
1. [Specific ambiguity]
2. [Missing information]
3. [Conflicting requirements]

Please provide clarification before I can create a task packet.
```
**STOP** - Do not proceed with assumptions.

---

### Step 2: Create Task Packet ✋ STOP

**Option A: Use template generator (recommended)**
```bash
just create-task-packet "WP-{phase}-{name}"
```

**Option B: Manual creation**

Create file: `docs/task_packets/WP-{ID}-{Name}.md`

Use this template:
```markdown
# Task Packet: WP-{phase}-{short-name}

## Metadata
- TASK_ID: WP-{phase}-{short-name}
- DATE: {ISO 8601 timestamp}
- REQUESTOR: {user or source}
- AGENT_ID: {your agent ID}
- ROLE: Orchestrator

## Scope
- **What**: {1-2 sentence description}
- **Why**: {Business/technical rationale}
- **IN_SCOPE_PATHS**:
  * {specific file or directory}
  * {another specific path}
- **OUT_OF_SCOPE**:
  * {what NOT to change}
  * {deferred work}

## Quality Gate
- **RISK_TIER**: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
  - LOW: Docs-only, no behavior change
  - MEDIUM: Code change, one module, no migrations
  - HIGH: Cross-module, migrations, IPC, security
- **TEST_PLAN**:
  ```bash
  # Commands coder MUST run:
  cargo test --manifest-path src/backend/handshake_core/Cargo.toml
  pnpm -C app test
  pnpm -C app run lint
  just ai-review  # If MEDIUM/HIGH
  ```
- **DONE_MEANS**:
  * {Specific criterion 1}
  * {Specific criterion 2}
  * All tests pass
  * Validation clean
- **ROLLBACK_HINT**:
  ```bash
  git revert <commit-sha>
  # OR: Specific undo steps
  ```

## Bootstrap (Coder Work Plan)
- **FILES_TO_OPEN**:
  * docs/START_HERE.md
  * docs/SPEC_CURRENT.md
  * docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
  * {5-10 implementation-specific files}
- **SEARCH_TERMS**:
  * "{key symbol/function}"
  * "{error message}"
  * "{feature name}"
  * "{5-20 grep targets}"
- **RUN_COMMANDS**:
  ```bash
  just dev
  cargo test --manifest-path src/backend/handshake_core/Cargo.toml
  pnpm -C app test
  ```
- **RISK_MAP**:
  * "Database migration fails" -> Storage layer
  * "IPC contract breaks" -> Tauri bridge
  * "{3-8 failure modes}" -> "{affected subsystem}"

## Authority
- **SPEC_CURRENT**: docs/SPEC_CURRENT.md
- **Codex**: Handshake Codex v0.8.md
- **Latest Logger**: {filename of current logger}
- **ADRs**: {if relevant}

## Notes
- **Assumptions**: {If any - mark as ASSUMPTION}
- **Open Questions**: {If any - must resolve before coding}
- **Dependencies**: {Other work this depends on}
```

**Verify file created:**
```bash
ls -la docs/task_packets/WP-*.md
```

---

### Step 3: Create Logger Entry ✋ STOP

Add RAW_ENTRY to latest `Handshake_logger_*.md`:

```markdown
[RAW_ENTRY_ID]
{next sequential ID}

[TIMESTAMP]
{ISO 8601 with timezone}

[SESSION_ID]
{HS-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-tag}

[ROLE]
Orchestrator

[PHASE]
{P0/P0.5/P1/etc}

[VERTICAL_SLICE]
{VS-Feature-Name}

[WP_ID]
WP-{phase}-{name}

[WP_STATUS]
Delegated

[TASK_SUMMARY]
{One line summary of what coder will do}

[METHOD_SUMMARY]
Created task packet and delegated to coder agent

[SPEC_REFERENCES]
{Master spec sections if relevant}

[LAW_AND_CODEX_REFERENCES]
Handshake Codex v0.8

[FILES_TOUCHED]
docs/task_packets/WP-{ID}-{Name}.md

[TOOLS_AND_MODELS]
{Your model name, Orchestrator role}

[STATE_BEFORE_BRIEF]
{Repo state before work}

[STATE_AFTER_BRIEF]
Task packet created, work delegated to coder

[RESULT]
None (work in progress)

[BLOCKERS_OR_RISKS]
{Known risks from RISK_MAP}

[NEXT_STEP_HINT]
Coder will implement per task packet WP-{ID}

[HANDOFF_HINT]
Read task packet docs/task_packets/WP-{ID}-{Name}.md

[NOTES]
LLM author: {Your model} per HL-I-042
```

---

### Step 4: Verification ✋ STOP

**Run automated check:**
```bash
just pre-work WP-{ID}
```

**MUST see:**
```
✅ Pre-work validation PASSED

You may proceed with delegation.
```

**If FAIL:**
```
❌ Pre-work validation FAILED

Errors:
  1. [Error description]

Fix these issues before delegating.
```

Fix errors, then re-run `just pre-work`.

---

### Step 5: Delegate to Coder

**Hand

off message format:**
```
Task Packet: docs/task_packets/WP-{ID}-{Name}.md
WP_ID: WP-{ID}
RISK_TIER: {LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH}

📋 Task: {One line summary}

You are a Coder agent. Before writing code:
1. Read .claude/CODER_PROTOCOL.md
2. Read the task packet above
3. Run: just pre-work WP-{ID}
4. Output BOOTSTRAP block per [CX-622]
5. Verify packet scope matches user request

Authority docs:
- docs/START_HERE.md
- docs/SPEC_CURRENT.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Handshake Codex v0.8.md

✅ Orchestrator checklist complete. Task packet WP-{ID} created and verified.

Begin implementation when ready.
```

---

## Task State Management (BLOCKING ✋)

The Orchestrator is the sole maintainer of task state.

### Step 1: Update Task Packet STATUS

When a task's state changes (e.g., from `Ready-for-Dev` to `In-Progress`, or to `Done`), you MUST edit the corresponding task packet markdown file to update the `STATUS` field in the metadata.

### Step 2: Update the Task Board

Immediately after updating the packet's status, you MUST also edit `docs/TASK_BOARD.md` to move the `WP-ID` to the correct column (e.g., move from "Ready for Dev" to "In Progress").

**This two-step process ensures both the detailed ticket and the high-level board are always in sync.**

---

## BLOCKING RULES (Non-Negotiable)

### ❌ DO NOT delegate if:
1. Requirements are unclear or ambiguous [CX-584]
2. Task packet file does not exist [CX-580]
3. Logger entry is missing [CX-585]
4. `just pre-work` validation fails [CX-587]
5. You haven't confirmed packet completeness [CX-582]

### ✅ DO delegate when:
1. All 5 steps complete
2. `just pre-work WP-{ID}` returns PASS
3. Handoff message includes all required info
4. You've confirmed coder understands the task

---

## If Blocked

**Scenario**: User request is too vague

**Response**:
```
❌ BLOCKED: Cannot create task packet [CX-584]

The request is ambiguous on:
- {Specific ambiguity 1}
- {Specific ambiguity 2}

Please clarify:
1. {Question 1}
2. {Question 2}

Once clarified, I can create a complete task packet.
```

**Scenario**: Missing context (no spec slice provided)

**Response**:
```
❌ BLOCKED: Missing LAW context [CX-031]

This task requires information from:
- {Spec section or context needed}

Please provide this context OR narrow the task to what's feasible without it.
```

**Scenario**: Too large/complex for single packet

**Response**:
```
⚠️ WARNING: Task is large [CX-584]

This task touches:
- {Multiple subsystems}
- {High complexity areas}

Recommendation: Break into smaller work packets:
1. WP-{phase}-{part-A}: {Scope A}
2. WP-{phase}-{part-B}: {Scope B}

Proceed with breakdown? Or continue with full scope?
```

---

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Vague scope
**Wrong:**
```
SCOPE: Improve the job system
```
**Right:**
```
SCOPE: Add `/jobs/:id/cancel` endpoint to allow users to cancel running jobs
IN_SCOPE_PATHS:
- src/backend/handshake_core/src/api/jobs.rs
- src/backend/handshake_core/src/jobs.rs
OUT_OF_SCOPE:
- Job retry logic (separate task)
- UI changes (separate task)
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Missing DONE_MEANS
**Wrong:**
```
DONE_MEANS: Feature works
```
**Right:**
```
DONE_MEANS:
- POST /jobs/:id/cancel returns 200 for running jobs
- Job status updates to "cancelled" in database
- Workflow execution stops within 5 seconds
- cargo test passes (2 new tests added)
- pnpm test passes
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Incomplete BOOTSTRAP
**Wrong:**
```
FILES_TO_OPEN: Some files
```
**Right:**
```
FILES_TO_OPEN:
- docs/START_HERE.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- src/backend/handshake_core/src/api/jobs.rs
- src/backend/handshake_core/src/jobs.rs
- src/backend/handshake_core/src/workflows.rs
- src/backend/handshake_core/src/models.rs
- src/backend/handshake_core/migrations/0002_create_ai_core_tables.sql
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Delegating without verification
**Wrong:**
```
I created the packet. Coder, start coding.
```
**Right:**
```
Running verification:
$ just pre-work WP-1-Job-Cancel

✅ Pre-work validation PASSED

Task Packet: docs/task_packets/WP-1-Job-Cancel.md
[Full handoff message...]
```

---

## Success Criteria

**You succeeded if:**
- ✅ Task packet file exists and is complete
- ✅ Logger entry documents packet creation
- ✅ `just pre-work WP-{ID}` passes
- ✅ Coder receives clear handoff message
- ✅ Coder can start work immediately without questions

**You failed if:**
- ❌ Coder asks "what should I do?"
- ❌ Coder starts coding without packet
- ❌ Work gets rejected at review for missing packet
- ❌ Scope confusion leads to wrong implementation

---

## Quick Reference

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create packet
just create-task-packet WP-{ID}

# Verify readiness
just pre-work WP-{ID}

# Check packet exists
ls docs/task_packets/WP-*.md

# Check logger
tail -50 Handshake_logger_*.md
```

**Codex rules enforced:**
- [CX-580]: Packet MUST be created before delegation
- [CX-581]: Packet MUST have required structure
- [CX-582]: Packet MUST be verified before delegation
- [CX-584]: MUST NOT delegate ambiguous work
- [CX-585]: MUST create logger entry
- [CX-587]: SHOULD run pre-work check

**Remember**: Better to spend 10 minutes on a good task packet than 2 hours fixing misunderstood work.
