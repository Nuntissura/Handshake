# TASK_PACKET_TEMPLATE

Copy this into each new task packet and fill all fields.

Requirements:
- Keep packets ASCII-only (required by deterministic gates).
- Use SPEC_BASELINE for provenance (spec at creation time).
- Use SPEC_TARGET as the authoritative spec for closure/revalidation (usually docs/SPEC_CURRENT.md).
- WP_ID and filename MUST NOT include date/time stamps; use `-v{N}` for revisions (e.g., `WP-1-Tokenization-Service-v3`).

## TECHNICAL_REFINEMENT (MASTER SPEC)

- NONE

## QUALITY_GATE
### TEST_PLAN
```bash
# Run before handoff:
just pre-work {{WP_ID}}
# ...task-specific commands...
just cargo-clean
just post-work {{WP_ID}}
```

### DONE_MEANS
- measurable criterion 1
- measurable criterion 2

### ROLLBACK_HINT
```bash
git revert <commit-sha>
```

## AUTHORITY

- Codex: Handshake Codex v1.4.md
- Task Board: docs/TASK_BOARD.md

## BOOTSTRAP
- FILES_TO_OPEN:
  - docs/START_HERE.md

  - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
  - path/to/file
- SEARCH_TERMS:
  - "exact symbol"
  - "error code"

  ```bash
  # task-specific commands
  ```
- RISK_MAP:
  - "risk name" -> "impact"

## IMPLEMENTATION
- (Coder fills after skeleton approval.)

## HYGIENE
- (Coder fills after implementation; list activities and commands run. Outcomes may be summarized here, but detailed logs should go in ## EVIDENCE.)

## VALIDATION
- (Mechanical manifest for audit. Fill real values to enable 'just post-work'. This section records the 'What' (hashes/lines) for the Validator's 'How/Why' audit. It is NOT a claim of official Validation.)
- If the WP changes multiple non-`docs/` files, repeat the manifest block once per changed file (multiple `**Target File**` entries are supported).
- SHA1 hint: stage your changes and run `just cor701-sha path/to/file` to get deterministic `Pre-SHA1` / `Post-SHA1` values.
- **Target File**: `path/to/file`
- **Start**: <line>
- **End**: <line>
- **Line Delta**: <adds - dels>
- **Pre-SHA1**: `<hash>`
- **Post-SHA1**: `<hash>`

## STATUS_HANDOFF
- (Use this to list touched files and summarize work done without claiming a validation verdict.)
- Current WP_STATUS:
- What changed in this update:
- Next step / handoff hint:

## EVIDENCE
- (Coder appends logs, test outputs, and proof of work here. No verdicts.)

## VALIDATION_REPORTS
- (Validator appends official audits and verdicts here. Append-only.)
