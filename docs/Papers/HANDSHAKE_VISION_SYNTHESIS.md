# Handshake Project Vision & Technical Synthesis

## Executive Summary (Plan of Record)

> Understood. I’ll deliver a short non-technical overview followed by an in-depth technical synthesis of the Handshake vision as described in the master spec. This will include breakdowns of the LLM architecture, governance system, user experience, and image descriptor pipeline.
>
> I’ll also compare Handshake to software products with similar interfaces and governance models. Lastly, I’ll include an addendum referencing the GitHub repo, emphasizing how its WIP workflow-enforcing templates support autonomous agent orchestration and how they’ll integrate into Handshake.
>
> I’ll notify you when the full report is ready for review.
